We had indicated on our year-end call and talked a little bit about the 15 class of new stores where we opened 10 stores, 8 of which were in existing markets.
And a lot of those opened up late in the first quarter, fourth quarter of 2015.
So we really didn't see a big cannibalization impact in 2015.
As we headed in to this year, we were expecting to see some cannibalization, and we did.
In line with our expectations, we hadn't really cited a specific number, and I'm not sure I'm going to do that today.
But we expect that to moderate somewhat over the course of the year.
The 2016 class is skewed more towards new markets.
Six of the stores that we're going to build this year, if we go to the high end of the range will be in new markets.
So we don't anticipate the same level of cannibalization in the back part of this year as what we saw in Q1.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for your continued interest in Dave & Buster's.
We look forward to seeing many of you at the Piper Jaffray conference, the William Blair conference next week, or the Jefferies conference in the following week which we're attending all three of those.
Beyond that, we'll be back to you in early September with our second-quarter results.
Thank you.
