And again, that really does speak to -- back to the China situation.
We're not sitting in a showroom waiting for people to come in and buy a car.
Our people are -- they're taught to go out.
It is a push business.
It's not a pull business.
That's a great question.
Guys, thank you very much for the time today.
I'll tell you what we've thought about doing, is coming up with very much like what we learned from doing this webinar.
We want to give you kind of a look in the future on the things we're talking about and that we've shared with our people out there.
What we have to do is measure it with -- we certainly don't want to share all the things with competition, but we've got so many things.
This 20/20 work team that we've had now for 2.5 years.
Great ideas that they come out with.
They've been working through these.
And I really think you're going to see the adjustments to our business model that will get us to this $5 billion in sales.
So thank you very much.
