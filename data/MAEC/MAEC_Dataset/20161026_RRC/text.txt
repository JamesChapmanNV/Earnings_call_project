<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
I think that when we went back -- let me take you back in time and talk out the acquisition, and how we evaluated this thing.
As we went through we recognized the Upper Red was really the dominant producing interval at that point in time.
We recognize that changing target interval, optimizing target interval was going to have, could have a material impact in terms of productivity per well.
And well result and EURs could improve over what we're currently providing for you right now.
With that, and we also think that also applies to the Lower Red and the Pink intervals as well.
So the same type of thing is going to happen.
With that, it's going to give us a fairly significant inventory of locations throughout Terryville from the Upper Red down through -- the Upper Red, the Lower red and then up shallower with the two Pink zones.
So not going to give you a specific number, but I can tell you it is going to give us a fairly significant inventory going forward.
Going back through the whole process, we think we will be able to grow productions down there fairly significantly and be able to drive down the gathering and processing rate as well because of the [pec].
And all be able to do it within cash flow, is what our acquisition models show.
We think it's right in line with what we currently have.
I'm going to come back to our analysis.
When we did our analysis we didn't look at Netherland Sewell's analysis, we didn't look at MRD's analysis, we did our own analysis.
My answer on this thing is when people have asked me this, we have what we believe is our analysis going forward.
There is a lot of confusion I think that has been out there historically between some of the different analyses that are out there.
As we continue to roll through this thing and get our arms around it we will provide more clarity, probably toward year end.
