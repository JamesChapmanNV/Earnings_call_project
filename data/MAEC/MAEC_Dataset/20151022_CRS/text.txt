Good morning, <UNK>.
Yes, I will let <UNK> take that question, <UNK>.
Hi, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
We captured all of that in that one bucket of costs as you can see and as you noted.
We said we were -- on the last call on the fourth quarter call that, if you take that $30 million and you look at it on a quarterly run rate, I think we said we had a pretty significant portion in Q4 and then we are kind of hitting our target here in Q1.
So, there is some incremental but not a lot on the fixed cost side from Q4 to Q1.
And then, whatever is left is, call it variable.
Yes.
As I mentioned, <UNK>, the $4 million was part of our operating income in Q1.
That was an insurance recovery.
We had some extra costs last year related to that particular issue.
So, it is just part of the flow in operating income.
That's going to move around a bit based on some interest rate swaps and some other things but I would say that could be fairly consistent on run rate.
Thank you.
Thank you again for participating on today's call.
We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Thank you and goodbye.
