Thanks very much
I do appreciate the streamlined disclosure
It makes life a little simpler, so thank you for that
A couple questions that come up just from both the commentary and some of the Q&A now
As I look at the gross sales for the franchise, you're running about $24 billion, plus or minus a little bit
It's really nice to see it stabilizing and trend up a little bit
Any plans to change the ad or marketing spend to potentially capitalize on this that might be able to jump start gross sales anymore? And, if so, any shift in how you might go about doing that between maybe product or distribution or digitalization? How are you thinking these days about that growth?
Okay
And just playing devil's advocate for a moment, you were very successful in gathering assets for the gold bond fund in the up cycle, but I think one of the constraints on the stock was the asymmetry that created for the franchise
Presuming you were at the early stages of a potential recovery from here, any behavior, any strategic decisions to potentially limit the amount of AUM that could come back into the platform? Or no?
And just one last one
Thanks for taking the questions this morning
In the, I think, press release or maybe your commentary - your commentary, I guess - you had mentioned that commissionable sales were down, I think about 15% or so, from prior quarters
As you look forward, maybe DOL goes through, maybe it doesn't, how does that impact the mix shift of the business and the blended fee rate, leaving aside market FX impact, all else being equal?
I read, I think it was in your supplement, where you suggested that your commissionable sales segment was down, part of the issue is that was down about 15% versus some prior quarter comparison
If that were to persist, what does that mean for the fee rate for the <UNK>, leaving aside - I understand markets and FX can be very big swing factors but leaving those aside for a moment?
Okay
