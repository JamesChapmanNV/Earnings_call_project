You know I think <UNK> it is something we watch closely.
And we want to make sure we are aligned.
We're definitely focused on moving forward.
I think some of the noise has been, has called some of the competitive nature that we've seen the rapid increase in.
In the past several months and so we're hopeful with that noise that goes away.
Things get back to normal and maybe some of the competitive pressures or abnormal competitive pressures are gone going forward.
Thank you.
Great, that concludes this quarter's conference call thank you for joining us today and your interest in Stewart.
Goodbye.
