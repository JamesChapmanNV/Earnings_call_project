Thanks, Paul.
This is <UNK>.
We are still looking to grow in 2017.
The past, as you said, we've probably been growing around 10% or a hair more.
And I would say we still hope to be able to grow at about half pace.
So the 4% to 6% range would be pretty satisfactory in this market cycle I think.
Yes, we did not dividend this year, Quinton.
Our plans are sometime in the very new future is to continue that.
It's down slightly.
Year over year it was less.
There was a significant drop from third quarter to fourth quarter.
But year-over-year it was down about, I believe it was $5 million.
This now concludes our conference call.
As a reminder, a transcript of this call will be available on the Company website at ufginsurance.com.
On behalf of the Management of United Fire Group, I wish all of you a pleasant day.
Thank you.
