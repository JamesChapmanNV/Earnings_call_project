We're trying to be transparent.
Thanks, <UNK>.
Sure, <UNK>.
Thank you so much for the question and, you know, it gives me an opportunity to just compliment Harry Arnett and the Marketing team and what a wonderful job they've done in really creating energy around this brand.
Both in traditional and in the new age mediums.
The Callaway Media Productions our digital strategy has been kind of break-through for this industry.
And it's creating a lot of energy and excitement.
It reaches a young part of the golf community which is very brand enhancing for us.
It reaches them in a manner which they enjoy interacting.
It makes the brand more accessible.
And, you know, as we look at that going forward, we really do see it as a comparative advantage for ourselves.
So I'm really proud of what they've done and you're nice to ask about it.
You see our brand metrics in terms of the brand strength appeal to more younger golfers, veteran players, etc.
, no doubt all of that is related to all elements of our strategy but certainly the Callaway Media Productions is part of that.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, everybody for calling in.
And we look forward to updating you after Q2.
Have a great season.
