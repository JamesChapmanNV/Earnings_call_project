Thank you.
So thank you again, everyone, for joining us.
We felt we had a good quarter, and we look forward to increased shipments and demand in the third and fourth quarter because of seasonality, construction markets.
And we look forward to reviewing those results with you in just a few months.
In the meantime, thank you for joining us on today's conference call.
We look forward to seeing you and speaking with many of you during our investor visits in the coming months.
Thank you very much.
