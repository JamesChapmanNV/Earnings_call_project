Right now we're right in that 2% to 3% kind of asset sensitive range, right around 2.5%.
The swap increase reflects the increase in our LIBOR-based loans and also the fact that we issued some CDs this quarter so we had an increase in some of the fixed rate liabilities as well.
So it was more of just an overall balance sheet management and making sure that we maintain in that general range.
And still believe that we'll probably continue to maintain somewhere in that 2% to 3% type of asset sensitive range for the rest of the year.
Thank you.
