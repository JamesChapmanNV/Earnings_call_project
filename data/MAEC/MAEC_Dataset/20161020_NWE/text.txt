Hi, <UNK>.
No, it's an accounting issue that any increase or decrease in your stock price has an impact, in terms of your carrying costs, associated with those assets.
So any increase you'd have in your operating expenses, you'd have a decrease in other income, and vice versa.
So, it is from a P&L perspective, no impact, whatsoever.
We've had some initial discovery, which has been just very straightforward, looking at the data underlying the case.
And there's been really, almost no public discussion about the case.
We are, obviously, communicating what we're doing, and why.
But there really has not been much conversation about it.
I would like to think, that in part, that's simply a result of the fact that gas bills have been trending down so consistently for the last 10 years, and we've done a very good job managing those costs for customers.
I think we'll speak from our perspective, the most recent ROE from our perspective, is from the hydro case, was 9.8% ROE.
No, what I wanted to be very, very clear on that, is, just because we didn't include the slides this time, that they are going to change.
They're not going to change.
We didn't really have anything, incrementally, to tell you on this call associated with that.
So that's why they weren't included.
And now that I'd known there's been this many questions, I would have had <UNK> keep them in.
(laughter)
Oh, its been a tradition everyone loves every year now (laughter).
And yes, we will give you -- we call them the drivers.
We will give you the drivers at EEI.
Way to sell tickets <UNK>.
(laughter)
Okay.
Well thank you all, again, for your interest here at the end of the quarter.
We certainly are pleased with where we are right now.
And it sounds like we'll be seeing many of you in just a couple of weeks.
Take care.
Thank you.
