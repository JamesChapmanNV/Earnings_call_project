The R&D expense is not really for the tools.
You'd see that more in our capital line.
There's some parts that get expensed that don't have commercial capability and things like that.
So it wouldn't be in inventory.
It would either be in capital for the moment or in R&D expense.
And both of those will be going up.
Thank you.
