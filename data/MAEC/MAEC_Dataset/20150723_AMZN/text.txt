Yes, thanks for your question.
We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business.
It's growing very well.
We like our position in it.
We think our website is very, very atune to selling online.
So we're very happy with that.
It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally.
So you mentioned a couple other consumables categories.
I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard line categories as well.
We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and subscribe and Save and others.
So very happy with the EGM business as a whole.
Sure.
Let me start with the first question on international media and EGM.
I think we're seeing similar trends in both geographies, both segments that EGM growth is much -- is very strong.
Media growth has been consistent for the last four quarters.
We do like the work being done by the media teams.
There's a lot of pipeline of invention, things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music, all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will.
They work great with our devices, by the way.
And they drive other non-media sales.
So they're very tied together, although certainly the EGM is outpacing the media segment or excuse me, media businesses right now.
On transportation costs, not a lot to add there.
Again, we are -- we have a combination of doing our own shipping and using third party carriers.
So the rate increases are staged and we see those quite frequently, nothing to add there.
On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we're looking to always to get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have.
And as we need new facilities, we place them closer and closer to customers.
So that can have its benefits as well.
Not much more to add on that one.
