Well, some of the preopening will start before because as you open up, let's say, the first several that opened in the first several weeks of Q4, much of the preopening is incurred in the month leading up to it.
But -- and Q4 is also 16 weeks versus 12.
So my guess, it'll be -- it will clearly be higher in Q4.
And I don't know how -- necessarily, how it sets us up.
There may have been a few weeks we've pushed to get into this year just to try to get them open.
So that saves you a little bit, but we do that every year.
Thank you, everyone.
Have a good day.
