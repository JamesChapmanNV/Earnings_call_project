So we expect to introduce this, as we mentioned, in the fourth quarter.
And it will be supported appropriately, to make sure the consumers know that we now have this with the Movado brand.
And it will be within not only the design aesthetics of the brand, but also within the price points that our consumers expect for the Movado brand.
So we really have not given out any information yet about the product that we will launch.
And we would anticipate giving out that information during the third quarter as we prepare for deliveries and introduction in the fourth quarter.
But it's a product that we are very excited about, and hits the sweet spot of the Movado brand, both from a design and price point.
Be for holiday.
(Technical difficulty) store for holiday.
And it will have limited availability as well.
We haven't finalized that yet.
No.
The increases -- some of the increases began late in the first quarter.
And then by the beginning of the second quarter, early in the second quarter, most of the price increases did take place.
I think it would be very difficult to quantify exactly the impact to gross margin, but it did offset, more than offset, a negative currency headwind of 200 basis points.
That and our cost reductions.
It was mixed pricing and our sourcing improvements, correct.
Obviously, that was when -- a year -- at last year end when we were looking forward into this year.
That was our estimate of what the impact would be, and because of that, we did things like the price increases and took other actions.
So our guidance does reflect all the actions that we're taking to react to what is now the new reality of currency.
Okay.
I would like to thank all of you for participating on today's call.
And we'll obviously update you again in our third quarter call, and wish everybody a very happy end to the summer.
Okay, thank you very much.
