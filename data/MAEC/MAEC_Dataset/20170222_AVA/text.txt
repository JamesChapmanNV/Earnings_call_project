No, the ERM will continue.
It is impacted, as <UNK> mentioned, we expect normal hydro, and then it's also impacted by natural gas prices.
The same impacts that we have every year, we have that same variability.
It won't change until we file another general rate case, or if the commission in their order petition, responding to the petition for rehearing or reconsideration, updates our power supply costs.
So otherwise we will have that normal variability until the next rate case, which would reset our power supply costs.
Correct.
If you recall it, <UNK>, we tried to do that back in 2006 and filed a power cost adjustment rate case, and the commission rejected that.
So we do not have that mechanism in our opportunity, but Puget Sound Energy does.
So we tried it and it was rejected, so we have to file a general rate case to reset power supply.
This is <UNK>.
It's primarily oil prices really.
When we purchased the company in July of 2014, oil prices were well over $100 a barrel, and they're half that now.
So that certainly created a bit more of a challenging situation with regard to economics.
They -- then there's customer conversion costs, and that plays into it, and access to low-cost financing and some other things.
But I would say the primary driver is just the cost of oil being what it is.
But we're going to continue.
We did -- we spent a lot of time looking at it and explored it, did a lot of really good, detailed work.
So we will continue, as <UNK> said.
We will continue to monitor the situation.
If things change, we'll reassess.
Thanks, <UNK>.
