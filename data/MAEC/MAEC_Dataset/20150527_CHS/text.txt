The answer is, right now I would say no.
I think that we are managing the inventory very articulately.
We do have plans for reduced receipts over last year in Q2.
Really across the board.
This should help manage the inventory.
And yes, absolutely we are looking at being less promotional in both Chico's and in White House/Black Market.
Chico's was especially promotional online last year.
And I think to try to move through a lot of the clearance.
And I think that, that is where a lot of the promotional pullback is.
And then there's some main events that they have pulled as well.
Strong holiday assortments.
(Laughter) Great marketing and a charged-up sales force.
Okay.
Well, we apologize for any of the questions that we did not get to today in the, I guess, 45 minutes or so that we were on the call.
As always, I'm available for any follow-ups if necessary.
Thank you for joining us this morning, and we appreciate your continued interest in Chico's FAS.
Thank you.
