It's hard to replicate Herald Square in other stores.
You're right; it looks fabulous and doing very well.
But we are taking ideas from there and putting them in other markets.
And part of it also is trying to mix experiences in with merchandise.
So I think we learn from Herald Square, although you really can't replicate it, per se.
Well, I think what you've heard us talk about for a long time is trying to have more exclusive products within our stores, whether it be brands completely or private brands, or exclusive products from some of the key vendors.
And that continues to be the case.
We also hope that our organization continues to be the best at curating these brands, and continue to give the best assortments that we can.
We don't give share counts.
You'll have to sort through that.
As we have stated, last fall and again now, being investment-grade is important to the Company.
And as I mentioned, our leverage ratios have fallen above -- maybe the word risen above -- our target range, and that we are expecting, with EBITDA increases, to get back into our target leverage ratio range.
Well, if you were willing to take on a lot more leverage, obviously that would change the dynamic.
So there is some limitation because of our belief that being a retailer, it is important to be investment-grade.
Thank you all for your interest, and obviously follow up with Matt or me if you have any further questions that didn't get answered this morning.
And thanks so much.
Take care.
