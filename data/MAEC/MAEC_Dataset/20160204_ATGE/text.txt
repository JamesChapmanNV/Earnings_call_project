Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine is an excellent institution.
It does have the risk of falling into the zone or longer-term failing to comply with the so-called Gainful Employment Regulation.
Yes, we have fantastic student outcomes and in fact, student loan default rate is close to zero.
Actually, in some years, it's literally zero, no defaults.
And so when you step back, it's an example when a regulation really doesn't fit and could have unintended consequences on a high-quality program like that.
When you take a ratio, everything from an Associate or a certificate to a Bachelor's, to a Master's, to a Doctoral professional level program, you can see how it doesn't make any sense.
And just given that fundamental value, we do think there are solutions.
For example, we could work with private lenders.
We also think when you have got that strong of a case, perhaps thee might be opportunities to work with regulators, work with legislators.
So the first set of measures are not scheduled to be published until January 17, and then program eligibility for loans would not be affected until January 2018.
So there is some time, there's some options.
We're in the process of analyzing all of those, and we will keep you posted.

The functional folks, internal audit; we have an external firm that does internal audit; we have an external audit that checks the internal audit, so there are layers upon layers of checking and controls.
A process that has been overseen for years by our Board Audit Committee.
This was stood up during the time of former Comptroller General of the United States chairing our Audit Committee.
So I think there are many reasons for us to say that we've got evidence that we had a good procedure and we reinforced those procedures.
We'll have to look that up and be in touch.
Okay.
Do we have any other questions.
