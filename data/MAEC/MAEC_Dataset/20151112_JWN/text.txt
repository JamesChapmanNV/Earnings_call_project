Yes, well, it starts with a consistent flow of fresh, new goods.
That drives all of our business, but particularly in the Savvy department, our ability to always have something new to show the customer really drives our success there, and we feel good about our plans over the next couple months.
You mentioned Topshop.
We have Topshop in 70-odd stores.
We're increasing that to over 90 by the end of the year.
That's been a real positive business for us and our partnership with them is really strong.
We have Madewell in approximately 30 stores, and that's been performing really well.
Another brand that we're happy with right now is, I'm spacing on it, Brandy Melville, thank you.
In our junior's department, Brandy Melville's a brand we've added to a number of stores, and our customers have really responded.
Our ability to find ways of continuing to be relevant to particularly younger customers who are shopping with us maybe for the first time, and we've acquired a lot of customers.
Our metrics around customer acquisition continue to be very strong, which gives us a lot of confidence as we continue to execute these plans and look towards the future.
