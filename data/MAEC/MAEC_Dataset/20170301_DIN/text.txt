This is <UNK>.
Not currently, no.
We are in compliance with our covenants below the level that we would payout, the 1% that I think you're referring to, of our debt.
So we don't anticipate that right now.
Similar to 2015 and 2016, which were consistent at about $15 million.
It's comprised of about three different items, but that will obviously move over to the current side and get paid out.
Thank you again for joining us on the call today.
We are scheduled to report the results of the first quarter on May 3.
Certainly, if you have any questions in the interim, please feel free to contact <UNK>, <UNK>, or myself.
And thank you all for your support over the years.
