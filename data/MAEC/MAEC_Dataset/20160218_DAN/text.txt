There was a $25 million pricing action, that benefited the EBITDA, that partially offset the supplier transition warranty cost that I mentioned.
That would not be one-time.
That pricing action continues into the future.
Right.
We haven't typically provided content per vehicle kind of data, and don't really have that at my fingertips to give that to you.
No, there is incremental content.
I can tell you that, <UNK>.
<UNK> is telling me no, so I guess no.
(laughter) Look, I like your effort.
Thank you.
We're certainly -- this is <UNK> speaking.
We're not looking for it to improve, quite frankly, in 2016.
We're just hunkered down there, doing everything we can to keep the cost base as minimal as possible.
So I think the improvement we expect is going to be post-2016.
Not significantly.
Okay.
Thank you again, everyone, for joining the call.
Just a quick summary, from my standpoint anyway, there's no question that we had a bit of a difficult year in the Commercial Vehicle group, largely due to currency in the Brazilian market.
But the group is certainly stable now, and improving every day.
However, I'm sure it's not lost on anyone that three of the four business units performed exceptionally well, and continue to perform at a very high level.
Even that, with some very challenging end markets, which will naturally improve some day.
Now, after six months at Dana, I would say I'm very excited about Dana, and our prospects, and frankly, achieving our guidance as we presented not only in January, but we reiterated today.
So thank you very much for your support, and joining the call.
Have a great day.
