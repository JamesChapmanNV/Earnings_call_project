So we do have some planned closings.
I don't think we've disclosed the specifics, but they're largely associated with Gap, following on some of the programs that we had this year, we had closings in our international largely and in Gap.
So there will be additional closings next year.
The other side of it is, <UNK>, nice to hear from you, I view Old Navy as an opportunity to incrementally open some additional stores, have some in-fill opportunity there, we're experimenting with a small store format.
That number as you know is a net.
It's a very different story if you look at an Old Navy or an Athleta versus Gap on the other side of the equation.
On inventory and SG&A where <UNK> said we'll be looking at everything with a fresh set of eyes.
The real estate footprint is the other thing that we need to look at over time, and we'll continue to think about whether we have the right locations and the best footprint overall.
I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.
As a reminder the press release which is available on gapinc.com contains a full recap of our fourth quarter results as well as forward-looking guidance included in our prepared remarks.
I'd like to apologize that we did not get to everyone's question, but I wanted to let you know that <UNK> along with the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for further questions.
Thank you.
