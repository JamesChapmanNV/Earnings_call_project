Thank you.
We do have leverage in the model.
I think as I mentioned earlier, margins are relatively flat this year but it's important for us to manage this business sustainably over time.
And when you look at the earnings guidance that we provided for this year, it's predominantly driven by operations.
Right.
And so our balance this year is to try to invest appropriately to drive growth long term while also generating high single digit EPS growth.
Well, we certainly do see the impact of consolidation because all of these transactions come to us initially always with the request of can you reduce our cost.
And while we are trying to accommodate our customers as much as possible, we also try to offer up solutions whereby we can do -- fulfill a broader set of their needs.
And in that context, I think we have continued to do well also because many of the technologies that we provide are essential and are at the leading edge.
So none of this is simple.
And as you well know, in our industry we've talked for quite a number of times, including at many of our earnings releases, about what's the impact of this.
Maybe especially in 2015 where there are a number of very large consolidations I think we have fared well with these.
And we're thankful for that.
But this is just part of an evolution in the industry around us.
And I think we are well positioned to continue to be a corner stone supplier to people that are really going to drive their own companies to the next state-of-the-art level of applications.
And that's a good position to be in.
You're welcome.
Well, we thank you for your attendance at this call.
As usual we will follow-up with a number of you after this.
And we hope that you have a good rest of the day.
Thank you so much.
