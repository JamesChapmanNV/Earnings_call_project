I'll take the first part.
Over the last 10 years, we've decreased the size of our stores by about 15%.
And the decrease is really just based on a reduction of inventory that we've seen over the years.
Today as we go out, and look for new stores, we right-size them, based on the market, and demographics, et cetera.
On the other part of your question, <UNK>, I would say that occupancy costs are fairly stable at this point.
There's good availability, in terms of locations, the rents are pretty stable.
And our new store opening rate is about -- we add about 6% more stores every year.
On the base of stores, we have, we opened 80 to 90 stores which is about [6%] increase each year.
And I would expect that we'll stay more or less at that level for the next year.
We're, as <UNK> said in her remarks, we were very happy with dd's performance in Q4.
And for the full year 2016, it turned in a very solid sales and profit performance.
And actually over a longer period of time, we've been pleased with that business.
But we've always been fairly deliberate about how we roll out and grow our businesses.
This was true with Ross, and it's also true with dd's, that on base of about 200 stores, we feel pretty comfortable being able to open 20-ish, 21, 22 stores.
I think it's unlikely, that we would accelerate that.
I think there are constraints, in terms of being able to do that in a high quality way, whether it's real estate locations or building the operational team.
We prefer to open and roll out dd's in a much more deliberate way.
Thank you for joining us today, and for your interest in Ross Stores.
Have a great day.
