The family business is important to casual dining and it's important to us.
It is a core equity for us.
We have not seen a softening, if you will, in that part of the business that's any more pronounced than any other of the challenges that the casual dining is seen.
So we don't think that's the issue.
We actually see more people going after that piece of the business competitively.
But we've got a strong base in family business and with millennial families we think that's an opportunity to continue to leverage that.
Our business has the uniqueness if you will, that not everyone has to be able to say hey, listen, there is an aspect of our restaurant that's more bar focused and got a little bit of a different energy to it and then there's this other part of the restaurant that's really more family focused and focuses more on what's happening at your table and around the table.
And more the food aspect of the menu aspect of it, with the alcohol playing a secondary role.
And it works great for us, and I think it works great for our guests and that again is one of those things that allows Chili's to be in a little bit of a unique position.
To be able to really work both fairly comfortably.
Thanks.
Thank you, Kate, and thanks to everyone for participating in the call this morning.
I would like to note that our second quarter FY17 earnings call is scheduled for the morning of January 25, 2017.
With that, everybody have a great rest of your day.
Thank you.
