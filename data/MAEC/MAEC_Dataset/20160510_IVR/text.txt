It was throughout the quarter.
Not necessarily all at once, but I would say generally earlier in the quarter going when we took off most of the swaps and sold most of the assets.
And basically, driven by the share repurchases that occurred, really in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter we were still repositioning the portfolio.
I think where we are, given our level of assets, we are hedged appropriately here.
Yes.
And I don't anticipate it's putting on a lot of long-duration assets.
Thanks.
I appreciate everyone dialing in today and we'll talk to you next time.
