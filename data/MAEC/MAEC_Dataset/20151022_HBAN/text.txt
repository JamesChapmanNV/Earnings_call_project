Hi, <UNK>.
I don't think that there's anything you should really read into that.
I think we continue to see very positive growth on both consumer households and on the commercial side of the business, some really good growth on the commercial side.
So, I really don't think there's anything you should read into that.
Thanks <UNK>.
Hearing no further questions -- this is <UNK>.
I wanted just to --
The operating lease income will attrite over time along with the operating lease expense.
So we're not going to do operating leases going forward.
As we renew that business or bring additional leases on they will all end up in the margin going forward.
You will see both the income and the expense related operating leases attrite over time.
Any other questions, operator.
We're pleased with our third-quarter results.
Our strategies are working, our investments are positively contributing to results and our execution is focused and strong.
We continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet.
We produced 5% year-over-year revenue growth in a challenging environment, and we remain focused on pricing and underwriting discipline.
We continue to invest in our businesses, but we've paced those investments to assure positive operative leverage.
We continue to work toward our long-term corporate goals, including becoming more efficient and boosting returns.
Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long-term shareholders.
Our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility, achieving positive operating leverage and driving solid, consistent long-term performance.
We are well aligned on these priorities.
So thank you for your interested in Huntington.
We appreciate you joining us today.
Have a great day.
