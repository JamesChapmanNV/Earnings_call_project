For contributors we're basically paying in US dollars and it's converted at the time of the transaction.
So if a customer signs up with us, we are converting that at the current exchange rate and then paying that contributor in US dollars.
Mobile is important for us.
On the buyer's side, it's still primarily the desktop where we see most of the usage for our images.
On the contributor's side and also occasionally on the buyer's side too, we see more and more usage through our iOS and our android applications.
Both of the applications we continuously released new features on, and reversed image search is actually something that's really important on the buyer's side.
We find that sometimes people that are creative, that are our customers, will see something that they like to use in one of their projects.
They may not be -- they may not have the equipment with them to shoot that photo.
They may not have the model releases for the people in that photo right in front of them.
So what they can do is they can shoot the scene that they're literally looking at and get images that look like that that are commercially released off of our website.
We think that's a pretty amazing shift in the way people buy images.
Our customers are really excited by it, and we see a lot of them using it.
Actually one more thing, on the contributor side, we've made it easier and easier for people to contribute images via mobile, and the cameras on phones, as you all know, are getting to be pretty amazing.
So we now are seeing more and more images come through mobile devices, and that's part of the reason why our library keeps growing faster and faster.
So we want to continuously enable our contributors to be able to produce that content right from their mobile devices wherever they are.
Thanks for joining us today.
If you have any follow-up questions please let us know you are in New York and we look forward to talking to you later.
Thanks.
