Well, the way the retail business works is they take inventory in Q3, Q4 to support diet season growth.
So we have five supermarket grocery chains that are -- will have product in diet seasons and Sam's, as well, and of course, Walmart.
And this was, again, something we had factored into our full year guidance for 2015.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks for your time this afternoon, and thank you for your confidence in this management team to lead and deliver results.
Once again, we're confident in our full-year double-digit growth projections for 2015 and believe we're well-positioned to grow in 2016.
We've helped millions of people lose weight safely and intend to help them do so in the future.
I look forward to sharing more about diet season 2016 and our 2016 outlook on our next call.
Have a good day.
