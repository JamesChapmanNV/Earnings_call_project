Thank you
So if it wasn't obvious already, June 21, 8 AM until 12:30 PM, greatest show on turf.
Well, probably not.
Probably there will be no turf.
But in all seriousness, we are putting effort into this.
I don't want to build it up too much as an investor day, but we are putting effort into this.
We know it's the first time we've done it.
In particular, I want to say that one thing that is really nice about this is that <UNK>, <UNK> and I will not be doing much of any talking, other than perhaps in the wrap-up and in the introductions.
And you will hear mostly from, and have opportunities to engage with, other members of our management team, some of whom you've heard on these calls and elsewhere, and some of whom you haven't, as well as members of our network partner base and, of course, Ms.
Orman, who I will say, she has an incredible track record on this HSA stuff.
She is on it and has worked with a number of employers, including a number of our clients, to really try and think through how this stuff works for a consumer, and is really impressive on the topic when she gets going.
So I'd encourage you to come.
I'm sure that it will be, as <UNK> said, worth your time.
And with that, thanks, everyone, and we'll see you in a couple weeks.
