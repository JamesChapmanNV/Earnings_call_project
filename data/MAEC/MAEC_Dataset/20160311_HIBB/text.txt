Sure.
I guess, I'm not understanding the balance question.
Yes, we're still, we're much more optimal than we were, but we still have significant opportunity to shift in that direction.
And again, it's really just ensuring that we've got what the kids are looking for today.
And I think as -- we'll continue to move in that direction, but certainly ensure that we still have performance-based product for the consumer that's looking for that.
We're more in balance than we were, but we still have significant opportunity, primarily with regard to store growth in that category.
Yes, we absolutely do.
I think, what we are trying to look at -- the long-range performance of those categories over the last few seasons, has not been in line with what's happened with our footwear business.
So we're trying to be conservative there, with how we're planning those businesses.
But at the same time, know that if we see opportunities, we'll certainly try and capitalize on them.
We do feel like we're making significant improvement in those categories, but those categories overall are a little bit pressured, and we didn't realize the gains based off the weather.
There's probably -- on the merch margin or product margin side, there's probably a little more opportunity in the back half, just based on last year compares.
But when you talk about total gross margin, there will be some effect on the warehouse and occupancy expenses, as we build out the DC for that fulfillment capability.
So there will be some additional expense flowing into that line, probably in the back half, it may offset some of that product margin favorability.
Thanks.
Thank you for being on the call today.
We're extremely excited about the future at Hibbett Sports.
As we get some of these capabilities from omni-channel, and continue to have great customer service, we feel like we're positioned very well in the marketplace for many years to come.
Thank you.
