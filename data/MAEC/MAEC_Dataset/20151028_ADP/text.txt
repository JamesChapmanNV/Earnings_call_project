It's kind of the same really, there's no difference.
We call it now segment margins, but those obviously do not include -- and PEO don't include any interest charges from the long-term debt.
So they are really unchanged.
Thank you all joining us today.
As you could probably tell from our tone, we're really excited about the strong start that we had to the year.
And we're really happy with our momentum, especially in our new business bookings.
You also probably heard our tone that we definitely feel like we have some challenge in front of us in terms of implementing all this new business so that we really deliver on our commitments to our clients to help them comply with the new and complex healthcare regulations.
But I think I also want to take this time to really thank all of our associates from sales, implementation and service for all the hard work they've done.
It's been a very challenging six months, and particularly a challenging quarter in term of workloads.
We appreciate everything they're doing and they're going to continue to do to build upon ADP's past successes.
Thank you again for joining us and thank you for your interest in ADP.
