Thank you.
Well, as far as labor, I think those are things that as you're opening newer stores, I was very hesitant obviously to protect everything to move down.
But what we've learned is more mature stores were actually growing volumes quicker.
So that's only made the initial move for a quicker reduction, as far as cross-training and so forth.
So now, I don't think I am going to do it any faster than I am doing it at all.
So I think I am very comfortable with the long term growth of where we are at and what we've developed over the last 6 months.
Are you talking growth over Q4 to Q4.
Yes.
So if you look at our new guidance, I think that gives us on the upper side of that 23% growth.
So we would continue on a long-term basis to look for that 20% growth going out.
Thank you.
Well, everybody thank you so much.
Jon and I appreciate your continued interest in Chuy's.
We will always be available to answer any and all questions.
Again thank you and all have a good evening.
Thanks everybody.
