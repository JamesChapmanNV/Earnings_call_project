It's too general a question to answer, <UNK>.
But in most cases, if there is an early term, we try to tie it to a specific contract.
And to the extent, <UNK>, there is an early term, there is most likely a penalty on the tenant side to reimburse us on amortized tenant allowance and leasing commissions to give them the right to terminate.
If you include the preferred as debt.
Is that what you're asking.
Yes.
It probably takes it up to 6.6, 6.7.
But that should be about the size.
If you include the preferred as debt, <UNK>.
Thank you, <UNK>.
Sure.
Well, we're fully leased at 250 West Pratt.
We have one very small parcel that we have a tenant we're negotiating with and the rental rate on that proposal or negotiation is a couple bucks ahead of where we had pro forma of the building, so we're pleased with that opportunity.
We had one chunk of space to lease at 100 Light.
We leased it at about 9% over our pro forma on a rental-rate basis; that tenant will take occupancy in October.
Our parking results are very positive at 100 Light.
We're beating our own plan by about 28% year to date.
Everything's going very well with regard to Canton Crossing, we did get our plan approved by the city of Baltimore.
And we continue to work towards the mixed-use development that we have toured you through recently.
All right, <UNK>.
Thank you.
Thank you all for joining us today.
If your question did not get answered, we are in the office and available to speak with you.
We look forward to the next call.
Thank you.
