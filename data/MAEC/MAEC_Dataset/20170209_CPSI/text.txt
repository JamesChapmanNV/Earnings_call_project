Yes, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
I think the cash flow that we have seen in the last two quarters is indicative of what the new normal is.
Naturally, as we can grow revenue during 2017 we should see that improve modestly.
But the past two quarters are more indicative of what we expect.
The first half of the year, the big story and cash flows for the first six months of 2016 was really, call it a ballpark $10 million investment of working capital related to the acquisition.
That was a one-time event.
With that clearly in the rearview mirror, the past six months are much more indicative of what we expect going forward.
I just want to thank everyone for their time today and being on the call, and I hope everyone has a great Friday and a great weekend.
Thank you.
