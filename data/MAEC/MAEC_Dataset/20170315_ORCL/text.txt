Sure.
For us it's no big deal, actually.
It's really very much a non-event.
I do hear one of our competitors talking all sorts of stuff about it.
No effect for us di minimus.
Maybe they are trying to talk about something else, but in our case we're not actually early adopting but it doesn't make a difference, really.
Zero impact whatsoever on cash flows and no impact on what we disclose to you or any of the things that this other company is talking about.
For us it's really nothing.
Thank you, operator.
Thank you everybody, and thank you, Holly.
A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours.
Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today.
Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call.
We look forward to speaking with you.
With that, Holly, why don't I turn it back to you for closing.
