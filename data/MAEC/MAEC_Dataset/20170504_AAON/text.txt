We'd like to thank you for attending our conference on this.
We are cautiously quite optimistic, and the operation of the company is going very well, and the Water-Source Heat Pump is behaving just the way we wanted it to.
We're being very cautious, so we don't incur any warranty costs.
We're being cautious, so we don't disappoint our customers.
And when we think we've got all the software debugged -- it's mainly a software debugging, it's not relative to the [prodish] on Water-Source Heat Pump.
It's all relative to the software.
We will be bringing in much more in the way of orders and shipping much more product.
So everything from our standpoint that we can see is optimistic.
We just hope the economy goes along the way we believe it's going.
Thank you.
Well, we've been in the Water-Source Heat Pump business for quite some time.
But it's been a very high tonnage, very specialty units.
We have been able to do the very difficult jobs that large units -- that we have were capable of doing in the Water-Source Heat Pump.
So those unique units we have been building for some long period of time.
The units we're bringing out now, you might say that we've gone from calculus down to the first or second grade -- only first and second grades got a huge amount of the dollar volume that's in the Water-Source Heat Pumps.
And so that's -- it's an easier, much easier thing to deal with, but it's much more volume intensive.
And so some of those units that you are seeing there reflect that.
It's not so much it's reflecting the Water-Source Heat Pumps that we're talking about building now.
We've just started.
.
Yes, see it's going to go -- probably the biggest one of those is going to be maybe $3,000 or $4,000.
The biggest of some of that other stuff might have been $300,000.
Thank you, again.
We'll talk to you at the end of the next quarter.
