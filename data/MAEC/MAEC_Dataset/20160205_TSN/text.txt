Good morning, <UNK>.
Thank you.
<UNK>, we are very optimistic about this year, and the foundations that we've built for next.
If you look at it next year, we've got more synergies coming.
I think we're going to prove solidly in the next few weeks and the quarter or so, that we're -- we've got great brands that are well-positioned.
I think protein demand is going to remain pretty strong.
I know we have great consumer relevance.
I'm not -- it's really hard to predict what input prices will be a year from now or whatever.
But if you just look at the macro view, it feels pretty good that they'll be reasonable, and certainly, within our ability to manage.
Should have plentiful supply of livestock.
We've got a great innovation pipeline.
Great cash flow, as <UNK> talked about.
If I look at -- anyway -- so yes, we're really optimistic.
Yes, we can.
That is the take-away.
Thank you.
So listen, we appreciate your interest.
We certainly appreciate your involvement in our Company.
We plan to carry this momentum generated in Q1 through the rest of this year, and on into 2017.
So we're off to the shareholders meeting now.
Hope you have a great weekend.
See you.
