Yes.
So I think <UNK> addressed this a little bit earlier, right, which is as we move through and we work with, with varying customers through the process that they have to make sure that they're comfortable with this -- the cyber IT and data security actions we're taking.
As we complete those reviews with a given customer, then we see that the process changes, and then our ability to sell discrete projects as well as new products improves.
And as we make progress with our customer base through that process, and we are making progress, then we see the opportunities to continue to sell new products.
And then also, those discrete projects improves with time.
So -- and we are seeing that occur.
Yes.
And like I mentioned at the beginning, the more rational that we get about the process and the more that we make progresses within our remediation and investment program in IT and security-related areas, the more we expect this progress to continue.
But at this time, it's not a trend.
Sorry -- we're -- how about we just -- and I apologize here.
We're not able to find where you're seeing that.
<UNK>, we <UNK>n't see it here, so we'll have to take it off-line.
So we're not sure what you're referring to, okay.
So we'll maybe .
.
Okay.
I'd like to thank everybody for their time and their interest.
And with that, operator, we'll terminate the call.
