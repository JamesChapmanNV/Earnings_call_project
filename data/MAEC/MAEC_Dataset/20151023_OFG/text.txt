The $7 million -- what we said was because of the accounting effect of this sale, going forward, we do believe the Eurobank portfolio will not have such a high yield.
And it should drop.
And we are in the process of working on our forecast, and we need to work on it to exactly size what it's going to be.
It's going to be much lower than the 22%, 32% that we have.
We are (multiple speakers) yes, yield-wise.
Yes.
It's something that it makes sense to us from a yield perspective rather than going out and buying mortgage-backed securities at 2.25%, we are holding onto our FHA originations and securitizing at a 3% and change.
So make sense for us and it's also tax-exempt so -- .
Can you repeat the question.
It got a little bit cut off.
Well, <UNK>, if you look at table 6 we show over there excluding acquired loans.
And so if you look at that, that should give you the idea of what is the decrease in our non-acquired book.
And we show a decrease in early delinquency and also at the [NPA levels EBIT].
We do that -- yes, we are in the process of starting that process.
The last one was what we presented last quarter.
And we will be continuing to update that, starting right now.
Thank you, operator.
Thank you also to all our stakeholders who listened in today.
In November, we will be visiting investors in Dallas and at the Sandler O'Neill East Coast financial services conference in Palm Beach.
So we look forward to seeing some of you there.
And our preliminary date for reporting fourth-quarter results is Friday, January 29, 2016.
So thank you again and have a great weekend.
