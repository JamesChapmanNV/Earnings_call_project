Diluted share count for the quarter was 9,152; for the year, it was 10 -- or 9.152 million.
For the year, it was 10.873 million.
Yes.
That has a little bit of everything in there; no one major item accounted for the increase.
On behalf of the entire Management Team, I would like to express our appreciation for the continued support we receive from our shareholders, employees, agents and most importantly, our policyholders.
We look forward to updating you on our progress in the near future.
