The Traffic was the bulk of the cost decline for the first quarter, though conversion was a little bit of an issue, as well, and that's some of the comments that we did talk about in terms of inventory and store payroll.
No, <UNK>, that's not what we said.
We are --.
No.
What we said was there's a store redesign project where we're fixing some merchandising, and the sampling of our stores -- we talked about it on Investor Day, as well -- just to create a more dynamic feel and discovery and browsability to improve conversion in our stores.
So, we said that we're going to test about 10 of these stores by holiday and 50 by year end.
But they're not new openings.
Closings are about 12.
Yes, I think at Investor Day we said, and correct me if I'm wrong, it was 98% of our stores -- 98% of our stores are cash flow positive.
Great.
Thank you all for joining us on today's call and for your interest in Barnes & Noble.
We'll report our second-quarter earnings in December.
Thank you.
