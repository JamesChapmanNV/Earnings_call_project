Thanks for the question, <UNK>.
We're just trying to be a little bit careful here.
The majority of the loans we put into non-performing are actually still performing today.
They are performing loans.
But these are loans where when we look at those particular clients we think that there is a risk that they will become non-performing sometime in the next couple of years if oil stays where it is.
Remember how quickly this move has been on oil.
It was only 15 months ago we were at $100 a barrel.
The move has been very rapid.
And we're just trying to make sure that we try and stay ahead of this so that we don't end up surprising you and ourselves later.
Yes, it was just a handful of credits, <UNK>.
I don't know if they were shared national credits.
But it was a relatively small number and they were all either upstream or services.
Some of it was.
There was one charge-off in energy that related to one credit.
That's mostly midstream and downstream.
When you look at midstream and downstream, that makes up the remainder of what we call the energy book.
When you think about what lower oil prices do, for midstream it's sort of a non event, and for downstream it's actually beneficial.
So, for our downstream clients, the decrease in energy prices will help them.
Let me answer those backwards.
Investment grade versus non-investment grade, I don't have that exact number in front of me but, as you would expect, we have a relatively higher proportion than others of investment grade.
So, think about the context maybe of a third to a half of our book would actually be investment grade.
And, as you would also expect when you think about a conservative underwriter like SunTrust, the criticized portion would be relatively low, and for us that's on the order of 20%.
The vast majority of our loans are first lien.
