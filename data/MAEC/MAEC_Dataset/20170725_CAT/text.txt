Yes, I'd say, <UNK>, actually I think not.
Because this time -- I've been in a career here at Cat a long time -- typically we have reductions in areas that are easy to find, so we reduce R&D or reduce other things.
In this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not future value.
They are areas of efficiency and consolidation and support costs.
We have really increased spending in many of the growth areas.
We protected R&D, by and large, and we protected things like digital spending.
So, we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected.
So I'd say it's different than we would have historically done.
This is <UNK> <UNK>.
I think we're focused on expanding margins in the segments.
And we have to be careful not to look at quarter-to-quarter margins in each of the segments, because they can fluctuate from time to time inside the quarter.
But on an annual basis, we're committed to the improvement.
