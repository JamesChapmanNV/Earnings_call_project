On a pure ROI basis, <UNK>, in terms of just the economics of whether a project makes sense or not, the capital coming in from a customer is clearly going to have an impact in terms of what that ROI is ultimately going to be.
That's just a discount of cash flow.
From a P&L perspective, I think you can see from the release and from our supplemental that you recognize just how that revenue is being recognized.
And it's being recognized over the balance of the lease.
And you can see that even on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I think the number is around $20 million, it was almost identical to what it was the same quarter of last year.
So that number continues to be fairly consistent on an annual basis.
There is not a lot of volatility, not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline in it.
As we continue to invest in those types of systems, we're actually getting capital contributions.
So I look at it from two perspectives.
One is just the ROI, whether the transaction makes sense, it goes into the math to determine whether a particular project meets our internal thresholds to be able to able to move forward with it.
And then the recognition of that particular revenue is done over the remaining balance of the lease term.
