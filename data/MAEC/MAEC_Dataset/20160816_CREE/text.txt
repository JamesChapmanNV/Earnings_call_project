There will be some, but I don't have a specific breakout for you at this time.
Obviously, it's a small percentage of the total.
So I'd say it's relatively modest.
And the reason I talk about it as more important in the mid- to longer term is today what we're really talking about is smart lighting that allows you to optimize the lighting environment.
When you start to think about smart lighting, which are really platforms for not only lights, but sensing and then some building analytics or environmental analytics, you're really talking about systems that start to add value at a fundamentally different level than just the lights.
And so that's not going to happen overnight, but I think it really creates an interesting opportunity for all the lighting companies that we can participate -- we can add value by more than just delivering great lights.
I don't know that there's any significant ASP or unit trend.
It's really a quantity of project trends.
So I wouldn't think of that as some dynamic as far as a big shift one way or another.
It's just when we had the disruption back in our fiscal Q3, we really created a project pipeline gap and it will take us two to three quarters to rebuild that.
Thank you for your time today.
We appreciate your interest and support and look forward to reporting our first quarter results on October 18.
Good night.
Thank you.
