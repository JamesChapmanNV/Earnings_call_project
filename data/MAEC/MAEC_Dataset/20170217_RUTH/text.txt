Hey, <UNK>, this is Arne.
I'm going to take this one from Mike.
That's a really question about mix.
There are actually two locations in our franchise universe domestically that are widely ahead in terms of comp sales growth.
One of them you can figure out these fits together, when you close -- with two locate -- our franchises had two locations in Downtown Baltimore.
They close and they're within walking distance of each other.
When they close one the one that's stayed on Pier 5 is having great comp sales, because we're recapturing the vast bulk of those sales.
We also have another franchise location for competitive reasons I don't want to say where it is, but they've done a significant remodel, done some expansion in terms of really good local marketing.
And they are one of our bigger franchise units and they're running well in excess of 10% comp sales growth.
If these kind of set those two issues aside, the large franchisee with the remodel and expansion in marketing and Baltimore, the domestic comp kind of lines up very similar to what we're seeing in company restaurant.
