We do believe there will be another program after this program is complete.
We're not really sure what the program -- we don't know what the program will be, of course, but we think that there may be some opportunity to continue to get some funding to help serve and provide broadband service to rural America.
Thank you, Sayeed.
As we've called out today, we're not satisfied with our results for the quarter, and we have plans in place to correct that trajectory.
But overall, I really believe we have the best portfolio of assets we've ever had at CenturyLink.
Now, it's really about execution.
We're taking these assets and leveraging them to drive revenue growth, EBITDA growth, and shareholder value over time.
And while there certainly will be some quarterly ups and downs with some bumps in the road along the way, CenturyLink's long-term trajectory, in my view, is positive and bright as it's ever been.
So thank you for joining our call today, and we will look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.
