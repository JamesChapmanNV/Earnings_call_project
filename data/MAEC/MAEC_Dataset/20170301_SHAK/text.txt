The cost of the free burgers will be in cost of goods sold.
And we haven't given any guidance as to what the impact of that will be, perhaps 20, 30 Bps to cost of goods sold.
But yes, the revenue associated with the free burgers is comped out on the revenue line, so that's a net of zero, but then the cost of the free burger ends up in cost of goods sold.
Yes, I think there's a lot of feedback, believe me.
The good news is it's working real well.
I think the greatest challenge for them is when you're at peak time and you've got a line out the door and you've got a line in the cloud coming in through apps, it's busy.
It's real busy.
I've been in many Shacks during those peak times watching it myself, and with Zach, our COO, spending most of his time with his operators, just saying, okay, this is great news, a lot of people want to use Shake Shack in a lot of various ways, now how are we going to take care of all of them.
So I think the teams are really excited about it.
They understand and know what a great new transition for our business this will be.
But it's not without its challenges and it's going to take time.
It's going to take time to figure that out.
That's a step we're working on to make it a great experience for our team, too.
The good news is, a lot of people seem to want to order on the app.
Wage inflation for the fourth quarter, we hadn't really quoted the number in the past, but mid-to-high single digits for us.
I just want to thank everyone for being on the call again.
And again, want to end by thanking <UNK> <UNK> for nearly four years of incredible service to Shake Shack and wish him the best in the next phase of his life.
So thanks to all and we'll look forward to seeing you out there.
Take care.
