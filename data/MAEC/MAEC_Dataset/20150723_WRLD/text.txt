Thanks.
So let me clarify on the $1 million, and then I'll hand it over to <UNK>.
We didn't say it was $1 million in net income; we said it was $1 million in gross sales per month, just to clarify.
And I'll let <UNK> answer from there.
As it says in the releases, $1.8 million in gross sales.
Actually, net sales.
But not net income.
It'd be 63% of that, approximately.
So the new customer volume and (inaudible) was down around 4.8% quarter over quarter.
That's number of customers.
That's correct.
I don't have the fourth quarter in front of me, but it may be.
There is a contract in place.
Again, it's too early to discuss that and speculate.
The annual grant typically happens in the fiscal third quarter.
Again, it's just too early.
We've [been on] this for days.
So it's too early to speculate.
It's less than 1%.
