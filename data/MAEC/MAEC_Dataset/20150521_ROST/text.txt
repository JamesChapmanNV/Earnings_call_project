Sure.
So on dd's first of all, we certainly are making some improvements and changes at dd's, but that's a business that we're pretty happy with how dd's has been performing over the past several quarters.
So we are very confident in the long-term future of that business.
So I don't think there's anything I would call out at this point in terms of changes that we're making.
In terms of the website, the website really is informational.
We don't have an e-commerce business.
We do track traffic to our website.
And over time, we've seen a growth in that traffic, but it is, I want to be clear, it is an informational website rather than an e-commerce website.
dd's specifically.
Yes.
So, yes.
dd's growth of traffic, both to the website and Facebook page and other areas of social media, we've seen quite significant growth in traffic, targeting dd's across those different mediums.
I would say -- you know, I would say a little.
On occasion where we think it's appropriate for the two teams to travel together, they'll travel together.
But overall, really, dd's, at this point, is 150-some-odd stores, so we have a bit pretty big pencil, and they go out and they shop different resources, different vendors, and they do it on their own.
But there is some slight overlap.
Thank you.
Thank you for joining us today, and for your interest in Ross Stores.
Have a great day.
