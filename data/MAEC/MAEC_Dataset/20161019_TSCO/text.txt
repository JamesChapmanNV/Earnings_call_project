Good luck to you, <UNK>.
<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
Two things to remember on Petsense.
One is it is not going to be a distraction for TSC and it will not really look to take any type of funding and resources from TSC.
As a matter of fact, it is a well run little company.
It is small in base today but has tremendous growth opportunity, and it will basically fund itself.
Don't worry about trying to run two businesses.
They're not going to be integrated.
It's a separate business.
It runs separately.
It has its own President and its own staff of people, and there will be no integration.
This was a strategic buy, not an integration buy.
There's the difference.

What we're saying is that our incentive compensation is based against our plan.
So as we move into 2017 and we create a new plan, we have to allocate to the incentive compensation expense line relative to our projected 2017 plan.
So as we go through this year with very limited incentive compensation in the expense structure, once we recalibrate next year and put a new plan together, we need to put an on plan incentive compensation.
We estimate that if we move back relative year over year that there would be an increase in the expense structure of $0.07 to $0.08 to the bottom line.
So having said that, we're just saying -- I'm just giving you notice that you need to adjust your models accordingly as a lot of people have been looking at this year's expense run rate and applying it to next year.
So you just need to be able to add in some incentive compensation into your model next year if you have not already.
Well, thank you everyone, and thank you for your continued support of Tractor Supply.
We'll look forward to speaking with you again in January regarding our fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 performance.
