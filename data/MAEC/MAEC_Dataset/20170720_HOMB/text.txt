Say, just maybe a couple of things.
Did I hear, I guess as far as the closing of the Stonegate deal, that it could be later this quarter.
I guess any better time line on kind of how you're thinking about that.
Okay.
All right.
Fair enough.
And then just on the M&A front, <UNK>ny.
I guess given kind of the size of the Stonegate deal, I mean it sounds like you're looking at handful of items.
I mean is it fair to think that they'd probably be on the smaller side rather than the larger side, given the integration and focus on Stonegate in the short term.
Is that fair.
Okay.
Fair enough.
Just maybe last 1 or 2 things.
You talked a fair amount about the payouts.
Just kind of the loan production.
If you look at the loan production in the last several quarters, has it been pretty consistent.
I guess is that the way it sounds.
I mean I know the payouts have impacted the net number, but the production numbers, have they've been reasonably similar quarter-to-quarter.
Perfect.
That's helpful.
Just the last thing, maybe just still for you, <UNK>, was the core margins that I hear, just kind of your thoughts.
I know <UNK> commented about the accretion, but just the core margin and the likelihood that you're not going to significantly raise the deposit cost in the core margin, assuming the recent rate increases is generally kind of flat to up a little bit as -- at least over the next couple of quarters.
