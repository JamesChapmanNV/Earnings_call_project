Regina, we have time for one more question.
So the Pro performance, Pete, in first quarter was approaching double digits.
Yes and I would add to that as we continue to look at overall traffic to the site as I said earlier, we have been extremely pleased with receptivity to the new functionality of the site from the consumer.
And I think that's representative in the results over the last couple of quarters, as well as the investments that we are making to make content more effective for the customers from a aggregation of data perspective as well as product information.
As such we have been extremely pleased with the sales from the site, the visits to the site have continued to grow, as well as improvements in conversion and average ticket.
So as <UNK> talked about, we continue to see those core fundamental categories continue to do well.
The single product categories, particularly in appliances and those categories, and again I think it's important to highlight that the store still plays a critical role in the omni-channel world.
Where our customers are choosing to either pick up or have delivered 70% of all of our transactions from those dot com from the store, with 30% still being parcel.
So we feel good with where, we are we feel good with the traction we're making and making the site much more effective and user-friendly.
Thanks Steve.
Thanks for your continued interest in Lowe's we look forward to speaking with you again when we report our second-quarter results on Wednesday, August 17.
Have a great day.
