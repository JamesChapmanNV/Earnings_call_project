I haven't seen data on it, but it's probably pretty consistent.
Thank you.
Great.
Thank you for joining us today.
We are very proud of the progress we have made this quarter, and we remain excited about the outlook for Proto Labs and its continued growth around the world.
I, again, want to thank our employees for all of their dedication and hard work in achieving this performance, and we look forward to updating you next quarter.
Thank you.
