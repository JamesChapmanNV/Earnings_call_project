Thank you.
All right.
Well, then, I'm going to close it out.
Hey, look, everybody, I really appreciate the questions today, and I definitely appreciate the continued interest in Quality Systems/NextGen.
I wake up every day figuring out how we're going to make this company better, faster, gooder and stronger as we move forward.
And so it's a privilege to be at the helm of this great organization and this great team, and I look forward to our future conversations.
So thanks, everybody.
