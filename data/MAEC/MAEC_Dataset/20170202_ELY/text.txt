<UNK>, I don't have the December share in front of me although <UNK> is flurrying through so if do you have another question, I might have that by the end.
Yes, <UNK>.
This is <UNK> .
It is early -- those expenses are front end loaded early in the year mostly Q1 and Q2.
That's probably a decent estimate.
Yes.
December was 13.4% <UNK>.
Thank you.
Well, thank you everybody for calling in.
We appreciate the opportunity to discuss the business with you and we look forward to updating you further on Q1 earnings call.
Thanks very much.
