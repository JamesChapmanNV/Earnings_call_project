Chris, what I can say is that we are continuously looking at our strategy and how we could advance it potentially through M&A.
We are consistently looking for opportunities to see where we have matches between those two, our strategy long term and where there might be an M&A opportunity that can match up and contribute or accelerate that.
And as always, when appropriate, we would say something about it.
But until then, we will continue to work on it.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I'd like to thank everybody for being on the call today.
I would certainly enjoy getting to know you over the years and I look forward with confidence to watching this great group of people build on our successes as a team and they're continuing to focus on the strategic plan that we have in place that's going to help drive the growth.
It's been my utmost honor and privilege to serve Cooper.
And I have nothing but confidence in the direction Cooper is headed today.
And I would really would like to wish everybody the best and have a great day.
And thanks so much for all the support you've given to Cooper.
END
