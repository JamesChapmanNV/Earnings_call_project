Thanks, <UNK>.
Yes.
I mean, when we look at it, less than 2% of our business.
We're not real strong in the UK.
It's really the question of what is the macro indicators all around Europe and the overall impact.
I think we're constantly looking at our cost structure.
We know -- you know we have some European restructuring initiatives going on.
So we'll continue to look and monitor that, but right now our teams, they felt the noise, they felt the shock, but honestly they believe we'll move on and things will go forward with it.
So right now we're watching it closely and we'll look for opportunities, further opportunities if we need to.
But right now the team believes we've got the right actions in place.
Well, <UNK>, it has usually nothing to do with compensation.
We really talk to teams about what we're trying to do, what we're trying to build, the momentum we're starting to get.
And they meet our leadership team, and really see the opportunities inside of the organization.
So certainly compensation has to be a part of the discussion, but, honestly, that's the very last thing we talk about.
So really everybody is excited to be part of this company.
We have a strong 140 year history, a great brand and we're now going to capitalize on that brand to grow in the future.
So people are excited to join us, and, you know, all the people that have joined us are excited to be here.
So they want to be part of a winning team.
Thank you.
