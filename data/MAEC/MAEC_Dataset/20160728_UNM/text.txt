It's a little like derisking a pension plan.
It's relatively neutral.
But you do get that benefit of being less sensitive to future changes and assumptions.
Yup, thanks, <UNK>.
Great, thanks <UNK>.
We're happy to take that as our last question.
I'll flip that over to <UNK> <UNK>.
<UNK>, thanks for the question.
We feel great about the results that we're delivering.
And your point about recruiting, we're seeing a very nice uptick in recruiting, and probably more importantly very strong growth in our sales management team.
So that new recruits who are coming on are getting a lot of attention and the success rate for those new recruits is improving.
We like the market environment a lot right now.
The market dynamics are very favorable.
Employers increasingly need the solutions that we offer, certainly working Americans need the solutions that we offer.
So we feel very good about our strategy.
Terrific execution of that strategy especially in field distribution growth, very disciplined activity levels, incredible capabilities including what we believe to be unparalleled enrollment capabilities.
We do a lot of core enrollments.
For every dollar of Colonial Life benefits that we enroll, we enroll $10 of other benefits which helps us with creating a very strong value prop for small employers especially.
A tremendous breadth and depth of our products, capabilities, and services, and finally just an outstanding leadership team and strong talent throughout the organization.
So we feel very good.
We had a very, very strong second half of the year in 2015, so we're up against some big numbers but we're optimistic.
Great.
Thank you, <UNK>, for that last question.
I'd like to thank all of you as well for taking time to join us this morning.
We look forward to seeing many of you at various investor conferences and meetings in the weeks ahead.
So Operator, this now completes our second-quarter 2016 earnings call.
