Yes, it's about $120 million and yes, it's sufficient.
You nailed it perfectly.
It's opportunistic, given where the market was.
We are carefully watching the market.
It's obviously been extremely volatile.
Even when you look at the trading of the 2020s, they've moved quite a bit over the last few weeks.
We will just remain opportunistic on several levels.
Our near-term focus is on the revolver and extending of the revolver and then beyond that, we will just remain opportunistic.
Thanks.
