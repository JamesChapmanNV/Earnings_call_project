Thank you, Joelle.

Yes, we're not expecting the swings that we saw this quarter.
There's a number of things, including the timing of tax payments.
So I don't think it's going to have any material effect; so, hence, we're still sticking with our $100 million in free cash flow projection.
Net of tax payments, yes, but (multiple speakers).
In the 5 times range.
5 times.
Yes, I think the acquisition expenses were in line with what we were anticipating.
And then there's -- unfortunately, there's a whole load of other bits and pieces that you -- we paid out that we -- for example, were part of the net debt deductions for purchase price; but essentially, come along on the balance sheet, and we pay them after closing.
So the number is slightly bigger in terms of the way that it flushes out, but not bigger versus what we expected to pay.
At the end of the day, there's some large numbers there, but it really had a minimal impact: some circa $800,000 in the quarter, $1.2 million for the year.
So it's still, once it comes down to the net income line, it's still a very, very small delta in terms of the translation impact, which was positive for the year.
Nonexistent.
I think we still would stick with our range of 4% to 5% of sales, which is at the higher end of the range this year as we were last year, because we've seen the organic growth.
So 5% is a good run rate for us.
Yes, sure.
So the external valuations have placed a higher portion of the purchase price on the [customer list biz], which does get amortized, versus the goodwill, which does not.
No, that's the correct way of thinking of thinking about the amortization.
