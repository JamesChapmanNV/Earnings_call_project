Thank you, WIlliam.
Well, we closed the vast majority of those stores after the wedding season, so they were essentially closed in the third quarter.
So the transfer is really a 2017 event.
Historically we have seen a very high transfer rate in the Men's Wearhouse stores.
And we will continue to monitor.
You know, we had a pretty strong tux year.
So it is hard to see that they had a material impact on us.
I mean obviously we are pretty dominant in the tux rental space, so to a certain degree, anybody that rents a tux is taking a little bit of share from us.
But we had another good year in tux, so I do not see the material impact.
Yes.
We think that might be playing a role and we think we feel that probably the most at K&G.
And we have seen some traffic improvements in the last week or so that we attribute that.
Yes.
I mean, we are going to be investing a little bit in some of our store remodels.
Our Joseph Bank fleet is going to be getting some, what I would say is some sort of paint and carpet kind of investment because those stores have not been touched in a while and we want to make sure that we maintain the experience that our customer expects.
In addition to that, we've got our IT spending, we have got some of the spending on things that <UNK> talked about, particular in omni.
And then there are some miscellaneous things around facilities and things like that, but we think $90 million is an appropriate amount.
That is down from last year in part because in 2016 we made some DC investments that won't repeat in 2017.
Thank you.
Well, thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to updating you on our next quarter.
