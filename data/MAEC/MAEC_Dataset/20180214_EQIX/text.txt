This is Richard for Phil.
I figure I'll take another shot at it.
Given that the expansion plans are for late second half '18 and the level of it, it seems like, to <UNK>'s point, that things could start accelerating at the end of the year and into next year.
And then the Verizon assets, you said, were kind of single-digit growth.
It seems like you would expect those to go to an Equinix level, 10-plus percent.
Are we looking at this the wrong way.
Or is it just level of conservatism.
And then a quick question on the Paris 8 dedicated hyperscale build.
Can you give us a little more color around that.
And is the future phase capacity reserved already for that customer.
Or can that be given to other customers.
Just a quick question going back to the investments that have been made this year.
You've obviously taken down quite a few acquisitions in the recent past.
Just curious, maybe tying in with Steve's departure as well, I mean, should we expect that pace to continue.
Or should we be in more of a digestion mode from an acquisition perspective.
Okay.
And then just maybe going back to the Infomart.
I mean, it sounds like maybe high 40s EBITDA margin if I interpreted your comment there correctly, <UNK>.
It's a very high multiple going in.
Obviously, there's a lot of expansion capacity on top of that.
I'm just curious, how are you thinking about the additional cost to build out that 40 megawatts.
And how are you thinking about sort of the returns here given the sort of high going-in valuation.
Got it.
And since I'm the last questioner here, maybe could you just give an update on the transition post Steve's departure, where you're at with the search, any comment on sort of how morale is and things like that at the organization.
