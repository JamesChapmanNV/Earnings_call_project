<UNK>, this is <UNK> <UNK>.
The range that we've been giving for total cost on 801 Marquette has been in the $15 million to $20 million range.
The size of the project increased by about 8000 square feet and so we have just narrowed that range down to be approximately $20 million because we think we will be at the higher end of that range now.
As far as timing of the expensing of those expenses costs, <UNK>, I don't know if you want to comment on that, but I would expect a number of those expenses to come due throughout the current course of the year.
We'll have to look into how much has been expended.
I don't have that number right in front of me.
Actually, we disclosed it.
We do disclose in the supplemental, I believe our cost in that now is about $8.9 million, so we've got some room to run in 2017 for more capital to spend.
But I think the key point there, <UNK>, is that we've increased the square footage in the building and I think we're still within the $15 million to $20 million range.
So I think the rent growth -- I think it's a better picture than where it was.
<UNK>, this is <UNK> again.
We are-- in terms of the mortgages that FSP holds on some of our single assets, we are anticipating the potential for some dispositions that would falter those repayments this year.
And we will keep you posted as we proceed through the year, but there are a couple on deck that are possibilities for this year.
This is <UNK> <UNK>.
It's primarily a function of new leasing is when straight-line rent goes positive and some of the leasing that we did in the third and fourth quarter is what picked that up.
And also from the acquisition that we made in December for Dominion Tower.
That was part of it as well.
No problem.
There's been a combination of both of those, <UNK>, but what we're doing is looking at the remaining lease term of all the leases we have when we acquire the building and setting straight-line rents.
So in most cases the leases have increasing rents each year, so we're sort of starting off with positive straight-line rent until we meet the midpoint of the leases that we acquire.
So, you know, I think it's more a function of that then above and below market leases.
I don't have a number for you on those.
We do evaluate each one of those individually.
Good morning, <UNK>.
This is <UNK> <UNK>.
The GAAP yield for the first full year is expected at about 6.9%, and the first full year cash yield is expected at about 6.2%.
You're welcome.
<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
Our expectations is to be a net seller in 2017.
Well right now were not expecting acquisitions, so I'd rather not give a disposition range because there's a variety of scenarios that we've looked at.
We will continue to monitor all five of our markets for opportunities, but our expectation is, broadly speaking, to be a net seller and to work on our objective of replacing the bridge financing for Dominion Towers.
What I'm seeing out there is there are opportunities out there and we'll keep our eyes open.
But that's not our expectation.
Yep.
You're welcome.
Just to say thank you everyone for tuning in to the call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Thank you.
