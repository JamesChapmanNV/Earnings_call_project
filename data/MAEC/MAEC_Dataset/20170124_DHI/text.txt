Thanks for taking my questions and all the color so far, voice is a bit raspy
Wanted to ask about your owned option mix and you've been one of the few builders that's successfully pushed pretty meaningfully back towards option
And this quarter seems stabilized a bit recognize that it's not going to be so linear
But over time, you can continue to mix that higher
Curious to hear if there's anything reasonably you can speak to in terms of either incremental successes or challenges that you found and striking your option deals? <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>, we're still not to our goal of 50-50 balance in our total portfolio of option and controls
Very happy with the relationships we've been able to expand upon with developers across the country
Key trade partners for us frankly in supplying the first raw material input to our business is land or lots
And we're very pleased with the increase of finished lots we've been able to tie up and partner with others to develop for us
That's probably driving a bit of our lot costs increase, as a percentage of revenue, or per square foot that we're seeing in our current deliveries
It’s a reflection of our strategy to try to have more lots provided for the Company finish, rather than us self developing as much
And we’re seeing a big benefit of that in our focus on our improved returns, and we're seeing that return to come up as a result of that
So there is no magic bullet to that
It’s building relationships, partnering with the right people, market-by-market, having the experience with them, and the confidence to get projects on the ground and work through them together
And as part of the lower investment in the west, a function of just really still being more of a cash market and given your focus on shifting towards this balance, it's kind of an intentional mix away from the west?
One housekeeping then as a follow up, on the warranty and litigation this quarter
Is there any color you can provide, just as function of just as you've expanded in markets just normal course of business? Or is there anything regional or more one-time in nature?
