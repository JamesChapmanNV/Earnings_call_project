Yes, very good strong traction.
And we were very pleased to see that we now have crossed the 1,000 customer threshold for our Ion product, which, of course, delivers the best possible performance across all of your web assets but is really focused on mobile acceleration.
So, very strong traction there.
And, of course, that's not surprising.
As we talked about, today a lot of our customers have over half of their transactions going to mobile devices.
It is a particularly challenging area for performance, particularly when the mobile device is using a cellular network.
Ironically, that's where users expect to get the best performance.
So, I think that's why so many enterprises are turning to Akamai and buying Ion for their mobile assets.
I think we said when we've shared before that when we started investing in a very significant way in sales a couple years ago, we were providing ongoing updates around how we were doing.
And then I think what we said is it's run rate now in the business and that it's not noteworthy to be talking about investments of a specific amount in any particular area.
You can expect that we will continue to make investments across all areas of the business, including go-to-market capability.
