Well we can let our numbers speak for themselves.
Obviously, we've had a record-setting attendance increases in quarter.
When you look at us, our global platform, I don't think there is any public theater in the marketplace that can say that their attendance increased 6.2 million patrons.
And that was driven both in Latin America and also in the US.
Although they are doing -- and have their strategies to the markets.
Cinemark has its strategies, and we think it is reflective in our results.
And we continue to perform very highly in every market that we compete.
And we applaud again our competitors.
And the kind of quality of experience that patrons have access in the -- throughout the theatrical experience.
Because we think it is good for the overall industry, because we have never seen them as direct competition to us.
We've always seen that our competition is to get people to the out-of-home experience.
So whether they are going to Cinemark or AMC or Regal, if they have a great experience, that's good for the entire industry.
I didn't answer the M&A question you had, and are some really high quality potential acquisitions in Latin America.
Whether they would be available or not is another question.
There's some really high concepts down there.
Thank you.
Okay.
Well thank you very much for joining us this morning.
We look forward to speaking with you again following our third quarter.
Thank you.
