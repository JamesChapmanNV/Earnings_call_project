<UNK>, there is a recognized cost of turnover.
So, as the salary levels go up, if you can reduce turnover, you're still going to be better off.
Right.
And, <UNK>.
Are you asking the operators when they're looking at new deals or LTC.
If you're looking to add a facility to your portfolio, what type of returns are you looking for.
Got it.
It's an interesting question, <UNK>, because I recall one of our first meetings with <UNK> and Isaac in this conference room when we were talking about Anthem and starting to build memory care properties and we were so impressed with their focus on the care, they had already developed a prototype, just looking at numbers which was the pro forma of what they -- the industry could be doing and Anthem in particular.
I told <UNK>, I said there is going to come a time in your development if this happens when people are going to be throwing money at you like crazy and we understand that we do not finance with one type of financing vehicle.
<UNK> has more properties than are financed by us.
We expect that sometime Anthem -- it's appropriate for Anthem maybe to finance in a different way whether it's to get debt to own their own properties or something, but one of the things that we have with our operators is an understanding of their health is our health.
And so if it makes sense for a different capital structure for our operators we are all in support of that.
Sure.
Thank you, and thank you all for attending and I just need to remind you that in order to invest in these two quality operators, you have to buy LTC since they are private.
So, thank you all for attending this morning and we look forward to talking to you after the second quarter.
Thank you.
