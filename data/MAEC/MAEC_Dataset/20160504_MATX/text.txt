Sure, <UNK>.
Okay, thanks.
<UNK>, as I mentioned earlier on the question on where is the Alaska integration, there is a little bit of additional costs as we wind down our final integration activity.
It's not material.
There is a little bit in there and that'll run through some of the final IT projects through the August, September timeframe is our current planning.
Yes, <UNK>, I think you framed the question correctly.
I think we gave you our best thinking on the second quarter.
I -- there's no reason to believe that the traditional third quarter being the strongest of the year followed by the fourth quarter with being slightly lower, falling back to our traditional second and third quarters being the best.
That certainly was amplified a little bit by the Alaska acquisition where in the summertime, that's when the tourism and construction activity peaks.
So clearly we think second and third quarter tends to be our strongest quarter traditionally.
Sure.
Okay.
Thanks, <UNK>.
Okay.
Well, thank you, everyone, for your participation today.
We look forward to catching up with you on the next quarterly call.
Aloha.
