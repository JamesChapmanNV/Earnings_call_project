Well, the issue is that if we ever went into one of these places like Turkey, there is, we will not see that we would be able to generate sufficient commissions to pay for the cost of going in there because there is not enough volume there.
But I do not quite see how that is connected with your idea of entering into the custody business.
I see what you're saying.
So it's not the esoteric regulations.
It is that we look at the cost and then we look at not only the cost of going in there but the cost of maintaining the operation and look at the potential revenue of how many executions we would do in that country and it doesn't balance.
Korea is a currency issue.
South Africa, you are correct, and we have been looking at the possibility.
Thank you.
So the, we derive our largest income from sophisticated individual traders and that is the most lucrative for us.
Secondly, the financial advisors and thirdly, introducing brokers.
The issue with the introducing brokers and the financial advisor is that they are more likely to have the Schwab kind of a customer.
The kind of customer that very rarely trades and as a result, it is not so lucrative for us.
So we like the folks, the individual traders, or people who trade in a group, or, obviously, hedge funds.
That's right.
Yes.
That is going well.
We are told that they are going to put more and more customers in our way and that they will begin to advertise our facilities, hopefully.
