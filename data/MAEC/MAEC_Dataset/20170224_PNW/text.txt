First of all, no question we had a weak fourth quarter.
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had positive sales, so don't know that that's necessarily a trend and I'm not going to look to the first and fourth quarters to look at a trend with us being weighted to second and third quarter.
But I will say we have a lot of -- business sales were up last year.
For example, State Farm started filling their buildings in 2015.
That wasn't complete until October of this year, so you'll have a full-year impact of that and we just see a lot of construction, especially multifamily homes, going on in downtown Phoenix.
So all the signs are pointing toward modest sales growth in 2017.
We are projecting between 0% to 1%.
So we will ultimately see what happens.
I think I will defer that until we talk about 2017 guidance.
We continue engaging with the parties in constructive settlement discussions and generally speaking, we believe the parties are motivated to settle.
It's really difficult to go into any detail at this point.
Everything is up for negotiation.
