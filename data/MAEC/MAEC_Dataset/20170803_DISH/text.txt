Hi, <UNK>
I guess first-off, we generally don't provide guidance looking forward
However, what I would say is, I think we're encouraged with churn and non-pay is running at a multiple-year low
I think we've talked about in the call before, there's probably three things I'd point to: one is definitely have a lot more discipline in place, from an acquisition perspective to look at acquiring customers that will be profitable and obviously, will be with us on a long-term basis
And in addition, I think our sales strategies have been more effective than they have in the past
Some of that has to do with the work that we're not solely focused just on providing a credit for our customer or rightsizing them into a package that meets their needs, whether that's with Flex Pack that we've talked about before on the call, or whether that's through other tactics, whether it's renewal or upgrade, et cetera
So just trying to meet the customers' needs and finding a package and equipment that's right for them
Then in addition, I'd say, obviously, there has been some operational improvements, we're executing better at a front-line level, both over the phone and face-to-face when one of our technicians is at the door
So, I think the combination of those three is encouraging for us from a churn perspective looking forward
I'll let <UNK> comment on Sling growth, if there's a question there
