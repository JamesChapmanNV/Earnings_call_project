Yes, our guidance pre-Netsmart was 3% to 5%.
And as we have updated guidance for the consolidated entity, we feel comfortable with that revenue range overall.
I'd say that's a good guess.
Thank you.
In summary, I appreciate everybody taking the time to spend with us on the call today.
Many of you who have been participating in this with us over the course of the last three-plus years have seen us do a lot of work here as an executive management team to try to take care of our clients, to solidify the base, to bring confidence back into the Company and to deliver consistently on financial performance.
We're pleased -- I'm extraordinarily pleased with the announcements today.
You see us playing offense on many different regards, not only on a global basis but on our organic investments, in research and development as a percentage of revenue.
We're leaning in, in a big way, on the Optum piece as well as the Netsmart piece, and this is a company that wants to grow profitably.
And you are seeing a team that is feeling quite good about where we are, circa 2016.
Thank you very much for your time today.
And we hope to see all of you next week in Las Vegas.
