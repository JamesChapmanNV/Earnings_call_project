I don't have it in front of me, <UNK>.
My apologies.
But I'll see if I can't rustle that up pretty quickly here, though, as we are on the line.
Yes, it was over $20 million.
Just a little over $20 million.

$2 billion US.
That's right.
Okay.
Well, if there are no other questions, we will end the second quarter earnings release conference call.
Thanks to everybody who participated.
And to the extent any other questions come up, feel free to give us a call here in St.
Louis.
With that, we will end the call.
Thank you.
