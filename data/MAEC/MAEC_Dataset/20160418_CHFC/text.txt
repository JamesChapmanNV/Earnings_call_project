Yes.
Good morning, <UNK>.
Thank you.
No, I would say not.
We went through that period of time where there was some concern about it -- about a considerable decrease in interest rates.
I think the market responded appropriately from that standpoint, and I don't see any headwind from this point in time, from a Michigan economy standpoint.
Thank you, <UNK>.
Hi, <UNK>.
It will.
Oh, that's a great question.
I haven't got to that much specificity yet.
So, we'll have to -- that will have to be something that we'll look into as we get closer to the date.
But I wouldn't think that -- my knowledge of Talmer -- it's not going to -- it's going to be 30%-plus.
So, obviously, it's got to be between 30% and 35%, so in that 30%-plus.
<UNK>, you didn't have enough.
You mean as far as the one-time acquisition transaction expenses.
Oh, gosh.
Well, we've estimated collectively $62 million.
Those will get split between the two of us.
You'll see a measurable amount next quarter as we continue through the process.
But I would say the majority of them will come in the quarter that we close, and the immediate subsequent quarter after that.
(Multiple speakers) So, you [won't] see the majority of that in the second quarter.
Yes, 50 -- I mean, when we were doing the modeling process, our models had them about 50/50.
Now, that doesn't mean it won't be 40/60, right.
But it won't be 30/70.
Thank you, <UNK>.
Thank you, Cynthia.
And thank you for the questions.
Again, we appreciate your time and interest in Chemical Financial Corporation.
We remain confident in our prospects going forward, by making Chemical Bank the community-oriented financial institution of choice in the markets we serve, and seeking to partner with like-minded institutions in the Midwest.
We believe we are well positioned to achieve additional competitive and acquisitive market share gains as we move forward.
Thank you again, and have a great day.
