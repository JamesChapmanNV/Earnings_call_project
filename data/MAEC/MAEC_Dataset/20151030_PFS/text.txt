Okay.
I certainly think that we're spending a few bucks, certainly we did with systems to make sure that our stress testing can be utilized certainly through our loan portfolio.
That has been done.
Right now I think if you look at for 2016, between $250,000 and $300,000 would be the cost that we think of more in the way of preparing for, you know, [defast], making sure we have the right modeling in place.
And certainly looking at our policies, because you can't just take what you had.
You had to move them up and make the fill gap analysis, so we look at a consultant in that regard.

I don't hold my breath, but I certainly hope that there's an opportunity and I think the regulators agree that some of the things that are being put on institutions of our size, and even some that are a little bit bigger, are a little bit over the top.
But we want to make sure we at least have the voice to, you know, see if we can get some of the regulations modified.
That would be -- that would definitely be it.
Right now we don't put in there and put a deal in there.
But again, if it's the right deal for our shareholders, we would -- and it's priced correctly -- we'll go through that.
And everybody kind of knows what's going to happen, but that (inaudible).
Organically we would not -- we'd model it out.
We would not hit that number so the earliest would be 2017 just because of normal cash flow, run off of pipelines, and the portfolios.
Thank you.
Well, we thank you and we look forward to concluding 2015 on a high note.
And we'll speak to you again in January.
In the meantime, enjoy what's left of the World Series and thank you again for joining us today.
