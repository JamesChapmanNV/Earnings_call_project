Yes, we are rolling out Bluemercury both freestanding and in-store, so I would say both there.
We are planning to open 24 freestanding stores this year and 18 shop-in-shops for Bluemercury.
And we're very excited about how they are performing and what they are going to be able to add to the Macy's location.
So that we feel good about.
We're also rolling out beyond these stores the proprietary brands from Bluemercury, M-61, which was just recently launched on Macys.com.
So that's also adding to our beauty arsenal.
And in terms of more brands, we are doing that in a couple of ways.
One is we have our Impulse beauty installations in so many of our stores, which are a combination of smaller brands.
We continue to bring new brands in and add to that footprint as we go forward.
On the upper end, you've got Bluemercury that also has a lot of these smaller brands.
So, yes, we will continue to do so and, at the same time, fully support the big cosmetics brands that are the bread and butter of our beauty department.
I would say if you look at the number of transactions, in the fourth quarter it was down 4% and in the first quarter it was down 7%.
So something really changed on that dynamic which negatively impacted the business.
Yes, center core did get weaker, but I think that's those key categories in center core, but I think a lot of that relates to the international tourist business.
So I think that's more of a factor there.
I think I would say we're just assuming that as we are giving guidance, and more importantly planning internally, that we don't think it's going to get better this year.
No.
Great.
Thank you all for your interest and your support.
As always, if you have further questions, reach out to Matt, reach out to me, and we will try to get them answered as quickly as we can.
Thank you.
