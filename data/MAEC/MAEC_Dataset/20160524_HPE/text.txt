Sure.
So listen, it is an uneven macroeconomic environment.
I think <UNK> said that at first.
And so different countries go up and down, different regions.
But overall, I think we feel very comfortable with our position in the traditional IT market, and then in our ability to provide solutions in a multi-cloud environment.
So I think demand can go up and down, but our objective is in whatever the market is doing, we want to make sure we at least hold or gain share.
And we did that in the last quarter.
And I do not think there's new to add as to why.
First of all, I think the R&D investments that we've made over the last 4 years are paying off.
So the development cycle in servers, storage, networking, those kinds of things, hyper-converged, these are long-term investments.
What you started three years ago actually comes to market now or even next year.
So that investment in R&D is paying off, and I will tell a dollar spent on internal R&D is the best dollar we spend at HP.
It is fantastic.
Second is, when you retool a sales force, that take some time, as well.
And I would say we are much farther along than we have been, and there is more work to do.
And then as I said, marketing, we have retooled our entire demand generation.
We've retooled -- and by the way, the launch of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gave us a chance to tell people the story of the enterprise side of this business.
Because prior to that, if you had asked man on the street, what is HP, they'd say a printing and PC company.
So I think that's actually been beneficial.
And then turnarounds takes 5 years.
(laughter) I said it when I started, and we're rounding the bend into the end of the fifth year.
And so it is gratifying that we saw as-reported growth for the first time in 5 years.
Thank you very much.
