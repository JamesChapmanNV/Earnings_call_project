Matt, it's in addition to.
And that's up from last year where we had a small percent taking the shakes.
Correct.
In terms of the media spend.
We expect it to end the year around 34.4%.
So we were a little bit below that in Q1.
Typically we're a little bit higher, it tends just to be a little bit timing.
So I would plan on it being a little bit higher in the fourth quarter on the back half of the year.
Thank you.
We'll provide color around what South Beach is driving and Shake360 next year.
But we're really just highlighting it this year because it's more of an investment year.
So you can see with the normal Nutrisystem business is doing excluding those initiatives.
Yes, that's all behind us.
We are benefiting from the new packaging and the dry ice issue is not an issue.
Okay, this is <UNK>.
So we are doing a test in mid-May in around 400 Walmart stores in the Northeast.
So it's a test into the freezer aisle which we are very excited about.
What we're doing is we're taking our kit concept which has been phenomenally successful in Walmart, our five-day kit concept.
And we're making in a one-day kit in the freezer, so you'll get breakfast, lunch, dinner snack, a one-day kit at a $12 to $13 price point for the day.
And we'll have four SKUs available for the test.
We are nationally distributed in Walmart as we speak today.
So any stores as this test progresses and its distribution is increased, it would be in stores -- we're pretty much in all stores for Walmart right now.
So it will be in a different place right now in the pharmacy aisle for Walmart, which is where our competitors are as well, but this would give us space in the freezer aisle, so another section in the store.
But more to come on that, it's just a test right now.
Thank you, everyone, for your time this afternoon and we look forward to meeting with many of you at upcoming investor events.
Have a great day.
