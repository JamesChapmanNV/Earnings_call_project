Thank you.
Actually, <UNK>, at the two properties where we have comp traffic, that is both Cherry Hill and Moorestown, holiday traffic was up.
In the case of Moorestown, up double digits.
In the case of Cherry Hill, low single-digits.
So the -- from a data perspective, traffic at those two assets were up.
From a sales perspective, which I think really is a good barometer as well, we are seeing our sales continue to move in a positive direction.
Even most recently through January, we are now approaching $470 per square foot in sales.
And we are adding, by the way, traffic counters that will become comp as time goes on.
But today, with specificity, just those two assets, and that is a positive story.
No.
I don't know that we did it.
We didn't laid out in the book, but we assume there's $100 million of construction financing, our share, on FOP.
There is an additional construction limit we have put on Woodland Mall.
And the balance comes from refinancing mortgages that come due over that time period and excess proceeds from those refinancings.

Excess proceeds from mortgages as well as construction loans in two of the larger projects.
Not at this point.
Well thank you all very much for participating and for engaging with questions.
We look forward to seeing you all at various investor conferences over the next few weeks and months.
Thank you.
