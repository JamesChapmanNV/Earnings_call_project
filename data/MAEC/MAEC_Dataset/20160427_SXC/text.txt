Stability would be the way I would say the dialogue, I would say our customers are basically running their assets well, but I would say obviously we have two plants that we serve, both Granite City and Ashland, that the blast furnaces are at this point temporarily idled.
I think both US steel and AK steel run the rest of their facilities, are running the rest of their facilities at high levels of utilization.
I wouldn't say we have seen any marked poll for more coke.
I would also say that we haven't seen any marked push back against coke.
In other words, the adjustments we made in the first quarter to support our customers that are doing the job.
I would note that we talked about hot rolled coil prices, and when I look at what has happened on Platts with the prices, net coke actually, it has increased sharply.
We just have to see what happens with the utilization rates.
But I would say sitting here today, I feel okay about stability.
Thank you.
2017.
Correct.
Yes.
Once again the customer accommodations do not make, do not impact our full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance.
That remains the same.
But we did lower our adjusted EBITDA per ton guidance, and it reflects two things.
The first is the shift of $10 million roughly from coal mining to domestic coke.
That's related to the transportation coast of procuring coal from third parties, as well as the per ton calculation is also impacted by the production decrease at Haverhill 2.
That's expected to be about 75,000 tons lower.
That's what is driving the per ton calculation.
The reclassification has zero effect on consolidated adjusted EBITDA, but it does lower your coke adjusted EBITDA for that segment, as well as per ton.
Right.
You are welcome.
Thank you very much again for joining us this morning, for your interest and for your investment in SunCoke Energy.
We will talk next quarter.
Thank you, good bye.
