This is <UNK> for Phil.
I wanted to follow up on the long-term contracts, the activity and extensions.
One, were these one-offs.
And two, how long does it take to put these together.
Can they come together pretty quickly.
Then I have another follow-up.
And then, I guess, the tower services business seems to have picked up a little bit.
Is that indicative of what we should expect kind of going forward.
Or is the activity more in-quarter.
Or is it kind of showing that tower growth in the future can ramp.
