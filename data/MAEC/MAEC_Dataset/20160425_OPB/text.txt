Before any other questions, I want to comment on a question, or more of a perhaps an incorrect observation somebody made through WebEx.
Someone was assuming that the correspondent banking -- this goes back to the little over $100 million of balances that moved out at the end of the quarter and came back in, they made the assumption that these were correspondent banking balances.
That's incorrect.
Of the $100 million roughly $20 million, $25 million of that was correspondent banking, and everything else was fiduciary banking related balances.
So I just wanted to be clear on that.
Any other questions.
I'm sorry, who is this.
The better way to look at it, at this point, until we give detailed color on PENSCO, et cetera, is we've guided that you should anticipate that our efficiency ratio is going to work its way in to the 30%s over the course of the year, and you can see that our adjusted efficiency ratio, when you take out all the noise of the first quarter, was roughly around 40%, 41%.
We anticipate that we're going to break into the 30%s over the course of this year.
I think that's probably in addition to all the other color that was given on the call related to expenses during the first quarter, I think that would be a good way to give you color.
Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call, and we look forward to talking with you on the second-quarter call.
Thank you.
