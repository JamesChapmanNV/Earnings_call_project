Sure.
I'll address that, <UNK>.
This is <UNK>.
So with regard to maintenance CapEx, it's probably in that $25 million to $30 million range.
And we classify maintenance CapEx with our landfill construction.
And we call that out separately in a lot of our presentations, just because some people classify that as growth.
We classify it as the maintenance CapEx.
So that's kind of that range.
With regard to main competitors in the marketplace, it really hasn't changed.
And it depends on what region of North America you're talking about.
The primary competitor it seems like in most regions that we come across Clean Harbors.
In many cases we come across Waste Management in most of our markets.
And then you run into other, whether they're smaller competitors or just in different regions, different competitors from that standpoint.
No.
It's been very consistent from a competitive standpoint.
Well thank you all for attending the conference call today, and we look forward to updating you on the results in July of 2016.
