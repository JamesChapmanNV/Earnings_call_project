Yes.
We're still comfortable on that range and we like the 20%.
Last year, when we made the moves, we just want to be very thoughtful on how we're moving into these markets and really backfilling it to make sense for us.
So yes, long term, we expect it to be a 20% and you'll be able to see that in the 2017 probably.
Yes, that's exactly it.
Thank you.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Jon and I appreciate your continued interest in Chuy's and we will always be available to answer any and all questions.
Again, thank you and all have a good evening.
Bye-bye.
