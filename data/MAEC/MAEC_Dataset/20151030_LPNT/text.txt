But that week fell into the quarter in both measurement periods.
Great.
Thank you, operator.
Our focus remains on executing within the strategic priorities that we described for you: improving quality and service, growing in existing markets and through acquisitions, continuously improving our operating efficiency, and developing high-performing talent.
Our acquisition pipeline remains active and our disciplined approach gives us the ability to expand margins in our recently acquired hospitals.
We have significant capacity in our balance sheet.
We believe there is additional Medicaid expansion in front of us.
These are among the factors that give us the opportunity to grow EBITDA and create meaningful shareholder value in the coming years, all while confidently making the communities we serve healthier.
So thank you for joining our call today and thank you for your interest in LifePoint Health.
