Yes, we're doing a fair amount of detailed work now, Matt, just looking at the IP investments that we could make and how we can simplify our IT infrastructure.
So, no dollars I would give specifically now.
We're working on that.
And we will expect to have more commentary as we give our year-end call.
And some of it may be shifting where we're spending some current dollars, as well.
But I do think we believe that simplifying some of the infrastructure can help speed our ink to green; also help us reduce costs and actually enhance our yield activity.
Now, we've started that that process, obviously, with some of the big data investments we're making, but that's kind of on the front end in managing the overall data assets that we get.
I'm talking more on the operational application platforms that we have more work to do on.
I think we're going to be methodical when we do that to make sure we are not causing any disruptions to our core operations.
So we could see some increased spend there as we go into 2018, but we will give more commentary as we give our annual guidance in February.
I think we expect it to be growing as we go into 2018.
Again, we will give more specific guidance, but I do think we're getting traction with the customer base.
And so I do think we will expect it to be growing as we go into 2018.
We will give more commentary on the degree of that as we give our annual guidance in February.
Well, I want to thank you all for attending our call.
As I said, we're diligently focused on providing the kind of -- generating the kind of financial results we know this Company is capable of.
We are bullish about our future and the new product offerings that we're pulling together in care management and member engagement.
And we look forward to speaking to you again on our full-year 2017 call in February.
Thank you.
