The share count reduction was the result of the share repurchase program that we executed late last year.
Yes.
We went through that authorization at the end of FY15.
The brick and mortar comp tracked very closely to the traffic decline, which was about a down 7%.
It's a little bit different results there.
We saw -- we obviously had a nice gain on the e-commerce side, and so most categories were up.
We saw particular strength in furniture, textiles, decorative accessories in the second quarter.
We saw the same weakness in art.
So I think a lot of the concepts we discussed around the assortment apply to the web as well.
Thank you.
Thank you everybody for being on the call.
Before I sign off, I do want to say one thing to our fellow employees down in the Louisiana area, they are dealing with a lot of struggle right now with the flooding.
We have a lot of team members down there who are going through some tough times.
We want to call out that and tell them that we're thinking about them and praying for them.
I just wanted to get that out there.
And the last thing I would say is we look forward to talking to you in the coming quarters about the progress we're making on all of these initiatives we talked about today.
So thank you for joining the call today.
