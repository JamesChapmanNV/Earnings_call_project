Good morning, <UNK>.
Yes.
We are currently working on a series of transactions and have been working on that.
In my humble opinion will come to fruition this year where we will be issuing a lot more equity with these families, certainly not lower than we issued equity to the public markets.
I think you will see more of that in terms of our pipeline, because there are things we started working on years ago that have come -- are getting closer to the finish line.
In terms of the families themselves, I don't really see yet any sort of acceleration one way or another because I think there's still some uncertainty out there in terms of tax reform and other things that could impact their decisions.
The good news is our pipeline is very active in terms of working with these families, but I can't tell you that it's made any difference in terms of what we see from a more external perspective.
Thank you.
Good morning, <UNK>.
No, they shouldn't vary.
We typically budget kind of a flat 1.5% of revenues as far as our bad debt first pass, and then we do specific tenant review each quarter.
So there's no difference in the guidance on that assumption.
That's kind of the way it's looking right now as far as what we see in the pipeline in the immediate future.
Our model, the way it works is it backs you into an equity need.
It doesn't appear that there's a lot beyond what we're seeing in the OP side.
Thank you.
In closing we'd like to thank again all of you for joining us today.
We really appreciate your interest in ROIC.
If you have any additional questions, please contact Mike <UNK> or me directly.
Also you can find additional information on the Company's quarterly supplemental package, which is posted on our website.
Thanks again, and have a great day everyone.
