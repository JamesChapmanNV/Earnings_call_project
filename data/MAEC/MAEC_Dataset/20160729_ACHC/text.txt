Thanks.
Thanks everyone for their interest in Acadia.
I know we spent most of the time talking about financial and processes that we do on the business side, but I do want to thank all our employees and clinicians in the field, for their dedication to our patients, and getting them better, and working with their families.
That's what makes Acadia successful, is delivering quality care to our patients, and the families, and it takes, we now have over 35,000 employees now, and it takes a lot of effort, and I very much recognize every day the work you all do in the field, taking care of our patients.
So once again, thank you for what you're doing.
Thank you all for your interest in Acadia, and we'll talk to you at the next quarter.
