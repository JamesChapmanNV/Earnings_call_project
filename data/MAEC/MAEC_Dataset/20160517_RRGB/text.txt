I mean, would say that our relative performance generally improved as we moved through the quarter, but it was volatile.
I mean, I think overall, when you look at the industry trends and our absolute performance, it was, it was pretty volatile as we moved through the quarter.
And my personal conclusion is, is the consumer continues to remain skittish, and very careful about how they're spending their money.
And whether it's going more towards rent or healthcare costs or savings, whatever it is, you're continuing to see them focus on value.
Which means we've got to be giving -- continue to give a great experience on the operating front, make sure we've got Ramen burger, and really great products that resonate with them coming in.
Yes.
And I just want to reinforce what <UNK> is saying, on the operating front, that is so much a part of the value.
It's not just the price you pay.
And we have traditionally, and continue to want to reinforce that we provide a unique experience for families and kids, now for adults in the bar.
And with Carin on board, we're really looking forward to reinvigorating our work to make sure that we stay a unique dining experience for those guests.
Thank you, Hannah.
We appreciate everybody's attention this morning, and look forward to talking to you here in the next quarter.
Have a great day.
