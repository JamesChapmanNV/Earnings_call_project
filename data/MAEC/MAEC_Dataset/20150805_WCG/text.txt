You're essentially asking directional guidance.
In the Q3 call just like we did last year we're going to lay out what we see at that time for headwinds and tailwinds.
But what I will tell you on all this rate changes they are fully reflected in this year's guidance.
And obviously you can infer the back half versus the front half based upon the MBR guidance that we've specifically given for Medicaid.
We reflected the rate they provided us even though I'll repeat we are in discussions with them on certain elements of that rate.
But it was in the lower half of the range they provided publicly.
Thank you.
I've just got three brief remarks.
First, I want to thank you all for your questions this morning and for your interest in WellCare.
Second, I want to summarize we are pleased with our building momentum but we are far from satisfied with our current level of performance.
And third, I do want to take this opportunity to thank our 6,400 associates for their commitment on behalf of our members and for their enormous contribution to our improved results.
Thank you operator.
This will conclude the call.
