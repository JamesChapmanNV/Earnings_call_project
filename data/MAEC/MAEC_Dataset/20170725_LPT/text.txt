So yes, I'm sorry.
Okay.
So they needed some trailer storage.
And so the reality of it is there was more land allocated to that building than the actual building itself.
And part of the rent that they're paying is for trailer storage on an additional approximate 10 acres.
A good catch there.
Okay.
Well, thanks, everybody.
Thanks for listening in.
Good quarter.
Have a great summer.
