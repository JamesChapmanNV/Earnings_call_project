Excellent.
Thank you, <UNK>.
Hey, it's Cort.
There is a little bit of seasonality in the third quarter, July and August.
But really, it's pretty minimal.
You bet, thanks.
Okay, thanks, Sarah.
And thank you all for your interest in Umpqua Holdings, and your attendance on the call today.
This will conclude the call.
Good-bye.
