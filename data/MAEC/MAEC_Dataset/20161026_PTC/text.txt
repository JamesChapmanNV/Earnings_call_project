I think at this point, we have a lot of data points to show that we are winning with our subscription offer.
We're competing competitively, we're competitive in many of the deals, especially the large deals, and 90% of them were subscription.
Thanks, <UNK>.
Great, thanks Kate.
And I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call.
As Andy stole my thunder a little bit earlier, the one programming note is that we're going to be hosting that webcast on November 11, 2016.
It will be at 11:00 Eastern time -- November 8, 2016, sorry, at 11.00.
Look for details on the coming days, on the details.
We look for you to you join us on that call.
If not, we will update you on our Q1 call in January, and with that I'd like to toss it back to <UNK>.
I just wanted to say thank you to all of you, for your support.
We feel good about the business.
I'm looking at Barry here, and the way we changed the strategy and the strategic positioning of the company, and the way we pivoted into IOT and analytics, in a way that is supportive of the core business, it is really just phenomenal.
I think about how we're changing the business model, and I'm looking at Andy, and the progress we are making on discounting, and business model, and cost containment, margin expansion, it's really phenomenal.
The one problem I had a year ago was execution in the core business.
And Craig isn't in the room with us here, but my God, that man has made such a difference in terms of improving our execution.
He is like General Patton, rocking all of us here.
Things get done and they get done well, and we have seen the results.
So I'm very pleased with the progress the Company has made in the last year.
It's really been a phenomenal year.
I'm sorry the Wall Street Journal didn't see it that way, but I'm confident that all of you here on the call do, and I certainly appreciate your support.
Thank you and have a good evening.
Good-bye.
