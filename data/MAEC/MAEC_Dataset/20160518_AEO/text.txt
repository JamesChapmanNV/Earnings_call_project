Right now, we are really highly focused on our core competency businesses, as I said.
We have a lot of opportunity within bras, undies, swim, and apparel for sure.
We did assimilate a team to venture into the beauty business, but we're going to walk before we run.
We're going to approach it very strategically and do it with some thought and integrity, to be honest.
Hello, <UNK>.
This is <UNK>.
I will take that one.
In terms of trend of the business, we don't really talk about that within the quarters that we're in.
But obviously, the first 2.5 weeks here are in the bank.
We have set our low single-digit guidance and we are confident that we will be able to achieve that.
As it relates to margin and markdowns, our margin will be up and a lot of it coming on the back of favorable sourcing and great IMU expansion.
As it relates to markdowns certainly in the back half, we are still baking our plans and assessing the competitive environment.
But again, I think the cinch point for you is, we expect margins to be up.
Okay, <UNK>ie, we have time for one more question.
For aerie, I will just clarify.
It was 30% of the total aerie business.
And then what did you ask regarding women's.
The apparel had some record highs in some of those businesses.
We look at the apparel business as a complement to our core competency businesses and that's how we're really approaching it.
For instance, in swim, cover-ups, and we'll continue to approach it that way.
Great.
Thanks, everyone.
That concludes our call today.
We appreciate your participation and continued interest in American Eagle Outfitters.
