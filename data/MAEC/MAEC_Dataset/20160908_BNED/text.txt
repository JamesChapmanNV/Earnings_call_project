It's total.
I'm sorry.
We didn't make that clear.
It's of our total sales or revenue.
Yes.
If you do the math and back off the general merchandise, that would be correct.
You're in the ballpark.
I'll let <UNK> talk to the process.
We order based upon our needs and we get enrollment feeds from the school on a daily basis for all of the schools that we serve for the most part.
We order according to our needs, our projected needs, to make sure that we have enough books to meet the needs of all the students.
That's our core mission of our business.
As far as the reduction in inventory, it really centered on, over the last two years, we upgraded all of our stores to our new platform, and there was a learning curve there over the last two-year period that resulted in some over-ordering at the store level.
Again, our books are all ordered at the store level by our store managers.
Because of that learning curve on our new system, there was some over-ordering that we corrected this year, so that will result in lower inventories, but it wasn't because we anticipated lower enrollments.
We order to the enrollment as it comes in on a daily and weekly basis the information.
We adjust our orders accordingly.
