Thank you.
Thanks, <UNK>
Good morning, <UNK>.
No, <UNK>, what we're trying to broadcast is the energy-- we expect we will have charge-offs to the energy that will move the allowance number, but what <UNK>-- I think did a real good job-- was giving you the provision for loan losses --
<UNK>, <UNK> actually referenced this.
We have $11 million specifically against the non-accruals.
And call it just under 3.5% of that 3.4% against all other of the performing loans.
Go ahead, <UNK>.
I think you will see a big make-up here in the second quarter.
We saw a fair amount of business slide into the second quarter, and we are benefiting from that in the early stages of this quarter.
<UNK>, I actually feel very good about the prospects for our loan growth.
Again, a lot of what we have done has been related to taking market share, earning new relationships.
And so as we look at our pipeline, our queue of opportunities, I think our bankers are getting more traction every quarter.
I want to go back -- you asked a very good question about the resolution of these four specific energy credits.
I want to remind you-- I don't really have to remind you, you all know, our special assets teams worked through roughly $2.5 billion of acquired, very troubled loans.
They did so very successfully.
We do not think the outcome with these four specific credits will be any different in terms of their ability to successfully resolve these situations.
So I think that is important context.
You bet.
Amy.
Thank you, Amy, and as always to those of you that had questions for us this morning, thank you for taking the time to research our business.
Very thoughtful questions, and we hope we answered them adequately.
And certainly invite any follow-up.
Have a good day.
Thank you.
