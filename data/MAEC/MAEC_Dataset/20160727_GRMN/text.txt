Thank you.
It seems like we don't hear <UNK>.
So in terms of product placement, certainly, there is puts and takes but we think we are generally represented well in every major retailer.
And we also have a very strong presence with the products that you mentioned, particularly, in the fitness and outdoor area, and specialty retailers.
So generally, we've been working hard on expanding our retail presence.
We've been working hard on improving the presentation of our products at retail over the past year.
We think that we've made a lot of progress.
In terms of integration of our apps with others, we already do quite a bit of that since we have integration with MyFitnessPal for nutrition tracking and we also have integration on the cycling side with Strava as well.
So we're very open to partnerships and we've been demonstrating that.
Well, I think we're our strongest marketing.
We're focused on the Garmin brand and we're focused on partnerships that enhance the Garmin brand.
Yes, so in terms of where we're at, it's probably difficult to precisely nail it down but we think it's somewhere in the 20% to 25% equipage that's occurred so far in the market with the vast majority of the equipage yet to come.
I think pilots and aircraft owners are just like everybody else.
They will probably -- a lot of them will wait until the last minute so we do see a building momentum as time goes on as we lead up to the 2020 deadline.
In terms of how we're doing, I think we're doing very well.
It's one of those areas where it's difficult to precisely nail down market share but we believe our share so far in the equipped airplanes is north of 70%.
It's in line.
Thank you <UNK>.
