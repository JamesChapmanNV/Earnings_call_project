I think, <UNK>, you've hit on exactly the right point there, which is, for us, the hardware revenue drives the higher-margin attach and the recurring revenue.
And <UNK> <UNK>, I'll turn it over to you to kind of describe those pieces.
But when we're talking about the additional revenue streams, you are talking about adding professional services, implementation services.
You've obviously got the hardware and software maintenance on the recurring piece.
Those are all drivers.
So, don't get me wrong, <UNK>.
We're laser focused on margin within hardware and being as efficient as we can.
But for us, it's about driving those more profitable revenue streams.
I do think you'll see 2017 as the new product introductions that <UNK> talked about roll out, you'll see hardware margins start to flatten as opposed to decreasing.
<UNK>.
You captured it on attach, <UNK>.
For hardware, as <UNK> said and we talked about earlier, it comes down to scaling the volumes on the new models and then the incremental cost reduction that we'll drive this year.
We have a very intense focus on cost, not only just for a solution going out the door but also for the total cost of ownership through its lifecycle.
So, that is an intense focus for us and we expect to see improvement this year.
Thank you all for joining us today and we'll see you in April.
