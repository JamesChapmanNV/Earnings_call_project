You're welcome.
Yes, so, look, we monitor virtually everything that comes to market, and there are a couple of large portfolios out there that we are aware of.
But we're going to remain disciplined buyers of assets.
And so, when there are opportunities, such as the assets that we just purchased, where we believe there is upside in it and in times when our cost of capital is appropriate or whatever, we may occasionally buy some assets.
But what I want you to hear loud and clear is we're going to remain disciplined through the process.
We think that has bode well and has helped why the Company's stock is where it's at today.
No, I think more realistically there may be some asset or assets within portfolios that we would be interested in.
Great.
Thank you for your time, and we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day in New York on May 17th.
And, of course, at the NAREIT investors conference in June.
Thank you for your time.
