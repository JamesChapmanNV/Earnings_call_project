Sure, good morning, <UNK>.
When you look at the profile of our seven companies, the ongoing investment levels and regulatory mechanisms, combination of rate bases and trackers, in any given year, the range of potential regulatory outcomes is probably the biggest single factor that could move our earnings outlook within that range.
And that's a well-diversified mix of regulatory mechanisms, so each state has either a rate case, as in Pennsylvania's fully-forecasted rate year mechanism, or a tracker mechanism, that are already well-established.
We tend to have a fairly confident outlook within the range, but nonetheless, can see a number of things that could change in any given year, relative to the mix of regulatory outcomes.
Beyond that, I would say there is O&M variability, could be storm related, could be operationally related in any given year, but by far the largest factor is going to be regulatory.
Thank you, Cat, and thank you again for joining us this morning.
We certainly appreciate your ongoing interest and support in the NiSource story, and look forward to providing additional updates in the not too distant future.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
