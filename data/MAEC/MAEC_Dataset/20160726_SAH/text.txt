Yes, sure.
We've been telling you since late fourth quarter, October and November of fourth quarter last year, that we expected to see an uptick in new car inventory; just because all the inventories that are out there, and we want to work with our manufacturer partners to help relieve those inventories.
But we began, February, March, really tightening down new car inventory levels in particular brands.
And as a result, our inventory is dropping, and we can -- we expect it to continue to drop.
And as your inventory gets in better shape, your margins go up.
I don't see any major shifts in where our margin is today versus what it should be in Q3.
A lot of it depends on our BMW/Honda mix and how that plays out overall, and what kind of volume we do with those brands.
So, we'll see as we move forward, but certainly it has stabilized.
All right.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call.
Have a great day.
