Thanks.
Sure.
I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.
For the team here at Acadia that are listening in, thank you very much for all that you're doing.
We're very, very proud of what you're doing on a daily basis in taking care of our patients.
And once again, thank you for being a part of the family here at Acadia, and we'll look forward to talking to you all on the next earnings call.
