Right.
Sure.
For 2016, I think we're still comfortable with the previous guidance that we discussed earlier in the year, which is around mid to high 70% range.
And for the last couple quarters, we're in that range.
And given the product mix as well as the anticipated pricing, we should still be able to maintain in that range.
Yes, we -- just another comment.
So, behind the scenes, we make a fair amount of investment in our manufacturing operations and cost-reduction activities.
And so, the price -- we've seen pricing pressure outside the United States for a while and maybe a little bit in the US now.
Yet, our margin -- profit margins have stayed the same or even gone up a little bit.
And that's a little bit due to mix, but a lot to do with the fact that we're continuing to lower our manufacturing costs and the reliability of our processes.
So, I just wanted to throw that other factor in there.
Thank you, Chuck.
To be honest with you, <UNK>, we have been pretty busy.
We don't have a lot of thoughts in that area.
I think, really, their viscosupplementation product has not been a real competitor for us.
And so, we really haven't paid a lot of attention.
We'll take a look.
Maybe on the next call, you can reask that question, and we'll have some commentary.
Thank you very much.
And thanks to everyone who participated on the call, asked some very good question, and listened to us today.
Appreciate it.
We're very excited about our plans that are current underway to advance our pipeline, bring some new products to market, and drive our continued growth.
And as a consequence, honestly, we look forward to updating you again on all of these activities on our next earnings call.
Have a great day.
