Yes, I think the ones I think is the best example is obviously our acquisition of Ebuys.
I think it has an incredible opportunity for us to evolve the DSW Inc model.
I will tell you there are several other investments that we have made that we're not in the position yet to disclose how we're going to leverage them, but I think there's some great opportunities for us to create different and unique experiences in our stores and using technology to create those experiences that force you to come to a DSW location or another banner underneath DSW Inc.
But we're not in a position yet, Ed, to be able to present some of those, but we have some pretty cool things we're working on in that space.
Thank you.
So I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and I really want to reinforce our commitment to driving our top line and improving this profitability of our Business.
We have significant work ahead of us, as I'm certain you could hear from the call.
But I know we are committed to creating a strong foundation that's going to drive long-term, profitable growth.
So, thanks, everyone, and we appreciate your support.
