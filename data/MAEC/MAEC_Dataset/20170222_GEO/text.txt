Our available bed capacity would increase by those 3,000 beds, so it will go from the 5,000 to the 8,000.
Well, the project is supposed to start November 1, I believe.
That's the current expected start date, and it is a fixed-price contract, I believe, from day one, so there's not a ramp up, per se.
And I think we've guided historically about $70 million to $75 million in net revenues to GEO on an annualized basis.
So we've adjusted for that in our numbers in the fourth quarter.
There's not a financial ramp up, but there is an actual prisoner ramp up that will take place over several months.
But we are paid the same flat rate as <UNK>, said day one.
That's right.
Okay.
I'd like to say hello to any of the CEC employees that may be listening and welcome them to the GEO Group and look forward to working with you.
And thank all the listeners to today's conference call, and we thank you very much for participating and look forward to addressing you at our next call.
