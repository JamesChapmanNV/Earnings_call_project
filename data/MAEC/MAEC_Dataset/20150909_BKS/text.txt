Well, I think specifically we really can't guide to the mix and what -- how much each contributed.
Having said that, we're quite pleased with the comp performance, given last year's very strong performance of books like John Green's Fault in our Stars, with the release of the movie drove really very strong sales.
Having said that, we have also called out the strong growth in toys and games and gift, and those are clearly seasonal businesses as well.
I wouldn't really characterize the mix going forward.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Great.
Thank you all for joining us on today's call and for your interest in Barnes & Noble.
This will conclude today's call.
