The Strategic market lives in the same exact infrastructure as the Mid-market.
Same management team.
And their per-employee, per-month is very similar to the Mid-market, especially if you -- a little higher than the Mid-market.
You're welcome.
There is no gaining factor, it's just -- like I said, building the infrastructure before you just bring on salespeople without the solution experts, the technical consultants who support them out there.
But no gaining factor.
We have people all of the time looking for great people.
If someone walked in my office right now and they were great, I would hire them.
Oh, yes.
We always grow average annual productivity.
We call those people legends, the ones you're talking about.
Thank you.
No, just -- hey, thanks for being on the call, and we'll talk to a lot of you in a few minutes, and the rest of you next quarter.
All of the best.
And you've got to believe out there, you've got to believe.
