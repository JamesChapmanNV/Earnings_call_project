Sure, <UNK>.
The purchase was for $43 million.
The Orleans is -- sits on land that it had previously leased and we had the opportunity under the lease to -- under our purchase option to acquire the land at a price that we felt was an attractive price.
There's no incremental development opportunity that existed before or after the purchase.
It just converted a piece of land that was being rented to one that we now own.
Yes, but you have to understand, this lease is not like the lease associated with a propco/opco structure.
It's a much lower lease rental stream that we paid.
Thanks.
