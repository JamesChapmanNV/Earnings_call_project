Yes.
This is <UNK>.
I think that one of the things that is true of the consumer electronics E-Commerce space is that it is evolving at a fairly rapid clip.
And so as we talk to Bernard Luthi and his team at Monoprice, the recognition is not just in terms of what are the initiatives underway at Monoprice, but also what's going on in the marketplace and how do we best keep pace.
One of the realities today is that more and more of the initial shopping and searching is going on inside of the large platforms like Amazon, and so you've got to be present there.
Just as years gone by people had made the same conclusion about the search engine.
And so I think that Monoprice is well aware of market dynamics and yes, it's focused on Monoprice.com and building that brand and also driving transactions through that web site, but they also have to be present in third party channels.
And I think they're doing a good job of getting fully present in them.
As it relates to Jet, I'm probably not in a good position to comment on that, but it will be an interesting thing to watch develop.
Thank you.
Thanks, everyone.
