When we look back over the last couple of years in particular, there are certain markets where certain organizations have banded together to sell the attributes of wood versus wood-alternative products.
We believe -- and a good example is the West Coast where they promote redwood.
We believe it's an opportunity for us to counter that argument and drive the sales with a very specific focused ad.
So our ads will basically focus on the variety of wood from that region that we think is the most susceptible.
And Redwood would be a great example in the western part of the United States.
It will be a comparison ad which will show the aging process of a new wood deck versus a Trex board.
And the optics are, basically, you see all the maintenance required with the board; you see the susceptibility to warping, staining, as well as insects.
We believe that countering those types of ads are very important, will be meaningful, and will move the needle.
And in reality, if you think about it, with 84% market share for wood, a single percentage point moving from wood to wood-alternative products yields a fairly substantial opportunity for the industry.
<UNK>, have you got that.
On a linear foot, it's 84/16.
About 30% in dollars.
About 30%, <UNK> advises.
You bet.
Thank you.
The outstanding performance by the employees of Trex and our business partners has made another record-setting year possible.
And I want to thank all of them for their contributions.
