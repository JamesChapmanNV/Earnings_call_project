I'll go ahead and let <UNK> take that one.
He is on the phone.
That's a good question.
Some of it is obviously the new business penalty we talked about in October, both on the commission side; and oftentimes new business, we don't know the customers well and losses will be a little bit higher.
As you know, we don't talk about our particular goals for combined ratio on each of our segments or on anything under the aggregate of 96%, but yes, you should expect as a company that we will try to be at or below a 96% with all of our products combined.
So we feel very positive about where we're at with agency, and we feel positive about, more importantly, having an ever-evolving preferred product model for them to be able to sell, to give agents what they needed to get us that customer that we had not had in the past.
And we believe the lifetime value of customers that have more products and are more preferred and stay with us because our rates are competitive ends up having more value to Progressive.
We absolutely differentiate on what we think the customer, each customer, the value it could bring.
So looking at a bundled customer we would look at differently than a monoline home or a monoline auto, but always getting to that 96% or lower.
We have not decided and, <UNK>, do you want to give any more color on that.
I really don't.
We are charged with letting our owners, if we choose to redeem in June, know by mid-May, and we will obviously do that, but we have made no decision as to this point.
Yes, when I was looking through some of the documents, we talked about tripling the number of agents, so you will read that in the letter, and then our plan is to more than double that.
So that's where we are at with Platinum agents to continue to make sure we have enough agents across the country as we continue to expand our coverage.
Yes, that was <UNK>'s -- yes.
