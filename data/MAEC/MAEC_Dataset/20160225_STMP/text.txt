Yes, in terms of the guidance, the sales and marketing spend is always -- we do plan for it to be higher this year than last year.
And it's really a dynamic process, monitoring the different types of spend, the efficiency, the results we are seeing, the expected ROI.
And optimizing that mix may be increasing some channels and cutting other channels that aren't working as efficiently.
So it's really a dynamic ongoing process to optimize the sales and marketing investment in the customer base.
Thank you, everyone.
