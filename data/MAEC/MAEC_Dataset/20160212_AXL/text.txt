Thanks, <UNK>.
Let me start first by saying we're highly confident that we can do it.
At the same time, as I covered with you, we're still quoting on activity that will support the backlog in 2018.
Historically we've run around $300 million a year on our backlog.
So 2016, 2017 are covered that way.
2018 is a little bit light.
But like I said, there's $500 million of opportunity that we're quoting on that could favorably impact the 2018 period of time.
We've got another $1 billion of opportunity impacting us in the 2019, 2020 period of time.
That business is right in our wheelhouse, as we just talked with <UNK> about trucks and crossover vehicles.
This has got geographic diversification associated with it and obviously, a significant customer diversification.
So again, we feel highly confident that we can offset it and again, that's just from an organic standpoint.
At the same time, we're producing things from a strategic standpoint, we're even more confident.
Thank you.
<UNK>, that would pretty much go across our entire product portfolio.
From an FX standpoint, the impact was primarily out of our products we ship in Brazil, which is GM and Volkswagen.
As it relates to metal, that impacts pretty much all customers.
<UNK>, those are gross backlog numbers.
Correct.
I'd say it's about the same.
As I said, we're starting to see some increase in our customer opportunities or our business opportunities but that's more on the 2019 to 2020 commensurate with where we're seeing greater penetration or greater needs for trucks and SUVs and crossovers in the future.
Thanks, <UNK>.
Have a good day.
Thank you, <UNK>.
We thank all of you who participated on this call and appreciate your interest in AAM.
We certainly look forward to talking with you in the future.
