Thanks.
No, there were some other things we talked about, some other delivery charges I think in there, and I think that was probably a third of the cost, slightly less than that.
But the depletion was the primary driver.
I think it's too early to tell.
I think now at some point in time there will ultimately need to be a rate case.
The fact that we're using Dave Gates differently, I would expect there would have to be a rate case, both from a FERC and MPSC perspective at some time in the future.
Right now we're still -- we're in the optimization mode, certainly still testing how this works.
We heard earlier about RBC and how that impacts things and so as <UNK> talked about, we're still looking through that.
Ultimately, to ultimately get the resolve from a revenue requirement perspective, there will be rate cases in our future.
Certainly there's that possibility.
We acknowledge that.
But the Montana Commission was I think quite direct in inviting us to file a natural gas case, and we think it makes sense to focus there this year.
Thank you.
Thanks, <UNK>.
Well, thank you all for the good questions and for your support for the Company throughout the quarter.
We'll see a number of you I know over the next month or so down at AGA and elsewhere and look forward to visiting with all of you next quarter.
This concludes the call.
