Well, most of the positives that came from Q2 in those areas were recent contract awards.
So we expect those to continue going forward Q3 and beyond.
Fortunately, those new contracts were strong enough to offset just seasonal declines with most of our other customers in those markets.
Yes.
If I were to describe the different customer segments that are negatively impacting our revenue line -- whether that's operators or land drillers or offshore contractors -- offshore contractors are definitely in the top of the list.
It's not much of our business in Canada.
We do a little bit off Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but not much as a percent of the whole.
And our Gulf of Mexico offshore business is low-single-digits percent of the entire US, but when you get to our international segment, that's different.
That's a big part of our business, is offshore market A in the North Sea and on Asia, Australia, Middle East.
We have a lot of offshore exposure.
So it continues to not only hurt us from the perspective that customers are no longer buying because their rigs are not working, but those rigs that are not working are supplying the other rigs that are working.
So, I don't know the percent total now, but in 2014, I would estimate that 50% of our international revenue was probably offshore-oriented.
Thank you.
I would like to thank everyone for their interest in DistributionNOW, and we look forward to talking to you about our third-quarter 2016 results.
Thanks.
