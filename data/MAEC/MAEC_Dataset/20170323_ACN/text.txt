I would say really no notable change in the competitive landscape in outsourcing.
If you're asking specifically about the application maintenance piece of our application services, that continues to be a very, very competitive pricing environment.
So that is more of the same.
And I would say if you look at BPO as another big piece of outsourcing, I would say no notable change.
No notable change but some at Accenture, again because if there is something we hate in our Company, it's commercialization of services.
So we're fighting against commercialization always to move and to rotate to higher-value services.
The business you're mentioning is subject to commercialization at great pace.
Our answer to fight against commercialization has been to infuse, as I mentioned before, through Bhaskar Ghosh and Debbie Polishook, leading Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations.
But a lot of robotics, a lot of automation, less labor arbitrage, more technology, more intelligence.
And so indeed, we want to make these activities more tech-automated-led, less labor-intensive like many of our competitors been doing.
And we are following a very different trajectory.
Okay, it's time to wrap up.
Thanks a lot to have been so patient with us.
Thanks again for joining us on the call today.
As you can tell, and have heard from <UNK> and I, we are very confident in our ability to deliver another strong year in FY17, to continue gaining significant market share as we do, to even further accelerate our rotation to new and innovative services.
And at the same time as we are investing significantly for the future, continuing delivering value for our clients, our people, and our shareholders.
At the same time, we transform Accenture to be even more successful.
We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.
In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call <UNK>.
All the best and talk to you very soon.
