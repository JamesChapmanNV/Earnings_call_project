Person0,"It's a higher COGS business model, so more variable type of cost model.
"
Person0,"So in terms of how we measure, consistent with what we've said in the past, our metric is ex market largely.
"
Person1,"There's some -- there's a few other items like FX, which is not that big this year over the course of 2017.
"
Person1,"It's ex wind downs, product sunsets, which again is not as big a number.
"
Person1,"So it's largely ex market and obviously less acquisitions to get to the 3%.
"
Person1,"In fact, it's a little over 3%.
"
Person1,"In terms of the growth going forward, I think early -- if you were to look back a year or 2 ago, it was mostly share.
"
Person1,"And we've made a big push to get more systematic on how we approach price and emphasis on innovation and new products.
"
Person1,"So those are becoming bigger drivers going forward.
"
Person1,"So we think those -- having all 3 levers at our disposal will help us grow -- increase the growth rate in the future.
"
Person0,"Well, no.
"
Person0,"I think, as we said, '18 is -- '18, we're getting our stuff together and moving on.
"
Person0,"I think '19 -- as we get into '19 and through '19, you're going to see a benefit.
"
Person0,"And then -- because we're not going to pop up from a low margin to kind of a 30% overnight either.
"
Person0,"So as we get through the first part of '19, I think you'll see the margins accelerating.
"
Person0,"And I think you'll see the very clear path toward the 30%.
"
Person0,"I think you'll see -- I think, from an organic perspective, you'll see the same pattern in '18 that we saw in '17.
"
Person0,"All things that Jim talked about there, I think will continue.
"
Person0,"I think that the high-level story is, I think, continued pricing, share gains and penetration by the core mortgage operations and I think solid growth by the nonmortgage piece of the company.
"
Person0,"I think those will be the same thematic points in '18.
"
Person2,"Great.
"
Person2,"And then the drivers of the guidance range, I think the range is a little bit wider than we've had historically.
"
Person2,"Just wondering, is that primarily on the volume -- origination volume.
"
Person2,"Or any other factors to call out.
"
Person1,"Are you referring to the adjusted EBITDA range.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"We've typically been in that $20 million to $30 million range.
"
Person1,"So this year isn't anything unusual.
"
Person2,"And the drivers of kind of the low to the high end, is it the volume.
"
Person2,"Or are there other factors.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"It's -- no.
"
Person1,"I mean, there's nothing unusual there.
"
Person1,"It's a typical range that we put together.
"
Person1,"The big thing, as you know, is the 10% downmarket.
"
Person1,"So there's not much more to it than that.
"
Person3,"On the segment reporting, I just want to make sure I get the moving parts here.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, are you guys still feeling good about the rule of thumb that kind of $20 million to $25 million of revs on every $100 billion origination swings.
"
Person3,"Is that still accurate.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"That's still correct.
"
Person0,"And that would be ex the valuation businesses.
"
Person3,"Okay.
"
Person3,"So it sounds like UWS -- I mean, obviously, now you have all the mortgage exposure there.
"
Person3,"So I guess on the base level, if the origination forecast holds about 2% decline of revenue and then you've got the incremental, I guess, diversification, is that right.
"
Person3,"Can you help maybe size that up a little bit.
"
Person0,"I'm sorry, can you repeat that.
"
Person3,"So about a 2% decline in UWS rev.
"
Person3,"That's where it looks like it will be jumping off.
"
Person3,"If the origination forecast holds, but then you guys talked about the, I guess, continued diversification efforts.
"
Person3,"Just trying to get an idea, is that kind of a good base level.
"
Person3,"And then kind of what we should grow -- how much faster we should decline that based on diversification.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"There's no real change in the sensitivity due to the market.
"
Person1,"So I don't think there's anything unusual.
"
Person1,"We've already kind of talked about the valuation piece.
"
Person1,"So there's not much there.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I think, <UNK>, the sensitivities Jim mentioned, that's kind of the, obviously, the nonappraisal portion.
"
Person0,"The reason why we don't include that, obviously, is because you got -- you don't have a market exposure.
"
Person0,"You have a client-specific exposure.
"
Person0,"And so that's why we kind of do it that way.
"
Person0,"But I don't think there's anything unusual.
"
Person0,"As Jim said in the UWS, I think they -- that we expect to continue to outperform the mortgage market volumes.
"
Person0,"So it's [down] percent, 10%, we tend to -- expect to do significantly better than that.
"
Person0,"We don't obviously guide by segment-specific level, but I think all of our exposure is in that segment for the most part and I think that will give you better visibility to our performance there.
"
Person3,"Okay.
"
Person3,"That's helpful, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"And then on the [margin-side] segment, I mean, obviously you guys don't guide to segment margins.
"
Person3,"But if we look at UWS, it seems like that's probably got the biggest leverage point in getting to the 30% kind of total company margin.
"
Person3,"Is there a kind of broad range we should think about by 2020.
"
Person3,"Like -- how much could you guys expand that margin from here.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I think it's hard to say.
"
Person0,"But you're exactly right.
"
Person0,"<UNK>.
"
Person0,"I think that -- and as I said in my prepared remarks, we're excited because as the purchase market goes and as the predictability of the volumes go, I think that, that's good for us and we are poised operating leverage-wise to pop the margins up.
"
Person0,"So I think that's a very good long-term value driver for this company.
"
Person0,"It's cash generative.
"
Person0,"It's high margin.
"
Person0,"We got -- and as we automate further, it should be even better operating leverage as we get into '19 and '20.
"
Person0,"So you're exactly right on that point.
"
Person1,"And as <UNK> said earlier, we expect both segments to be above the 30% target by 2020.
