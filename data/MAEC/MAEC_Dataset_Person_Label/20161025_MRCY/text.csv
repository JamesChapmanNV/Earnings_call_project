Person,Sentence
Person0,"You're welcome.
"
Person0,"We don't break out the bookings and backlog on organic and acquired basis.
"
Person0,"Couple of reasons for that.
"
Person0,"One is as I said the lines are blending quickly as we see more and more what I would call combined opportunities to bring the technology package to bare.
"
Person0,"Second is that as <UNK> said, I think what the important thing was from our perspective is the bookings performance solid and the answer is a resounding yes.
"
Person0,"We've been extremely pleased both for the two-month period that we owned them last quarter and for the first three months that we owned them in Q1.
"
Person0,"So they've actually come in line with organic Mercury and that's really what we want to see and that was pretty amply illustrated by the 1.1 book-to-bill for the quarter on a combined basis.
"
Person0,"Bottom line is we're very happy with the way they've come around.
"
Person1,"So, as I said previously, <UNK>, when you look at the revised guidance on a pro forma basis assuming that the acquired business did approximately $100 million of revenue in fiscal 2016 meaning we had owned it for the full year, that would translate into a pro forma growth rate of between 5% to 8% year-over-year on a combined basis.
"
Person1,"We expect both the organic business and the acquired business to grow within those growth ranges.
"
Person1,"For the acquired business, that would result in increasing growth versus where they were last -- the year before we owned them.
"
Person1,"From a Patriot perspective, we did receive a large order for Patriot during Q1.
"
Person1,"And we have increased our revenue forecasts for the Patriot program versus where we were last quarter.
"
Person1,"Paveway is an existing program for them.
"
Person1,"They received a large booking.
"
Person1,"We received a large booking during the quarter as well as a long-term supply agreement with Raytheon that we're very pleased about.
"
Person1,"I'm not going to comment specifically, about the content per program or per missile.
"
Person1,"But we are providing some innovative technology across several of the programs that I previously discussed.
"
Person1,"Well, thanks very much, Andrea and thanks everyone for listening.
"
Person1,"Again we hope to see you at our investor day in New York City on November 8, 2016.
"
Person1,"That concludes the call.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
