Person0,"So certainly being up 6.6% in the third gives us a lot of confidence as we lay in our plans for next year's digital deployment.
"
Person0,"This year, we wanted to see how it played out.
"
Person0,"We are going to come in at probably -- not counting the new Clear Channel boards, probably somewhere around 110-ish.
"
Person0,"So a little lighter than our usual buildout.
"
Person0,"I would anticipate that we will accelerate that going into 2017.
"
Person0,"I do not have a number for you yet.
"
Person0,"But all the trend lines indicating that we should be more aggressive next year than we were this year.
"
Person0,"Traditionally, I've said that 30% of our market's total revenue's coming from digital seems to be about where it is shaking out.
"
Person0,"We have some markets that are more than that.
"
Person0,"And we have a number of markets that are below that.
"
Person0,"If you look at our whole footprint, we are at about 20%.
"
Person0,"So give or take $300 million on give or take $1.5 billion, this also tells me that we've got some running room.
"
Person0,"But those are guesstimates.
"
Person0,"We still have a lot to learn about digital.
"
Person0,"I would point out that UK's experience in the UK, digital billing for out of home has surpassed 50%, which is quite a number.
"
Person0,"But, anyway, that is where we are.
"
Person0,"I think we still have runway even if it tops out at 30%, we are 20% so we have got lots of running room and the platform is growing.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"I think it's a tad lighter on the new builds.
"
Person0,"But the most pleasant surprise, <UNK>, has been what it costs us on the maintenance CapEx side as we retire early generation digitals.
"
Person0,"Certainly the cost has come down.
"
Person0,"But more importantly, the performance has been enhanced.
"
Person0,"We are experiencing a much longer life from these units than we had anticipated when we first started deploying digital some 10, 12 years ago.
"
Person0,"So it's a combination of costs coming down, useful life being prolonged, and really just a much more efficient unit that is coming in from all of our vendors, really, at a price point that has been pleasant to watch.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Well thank you, Chantel, and thank you, all, for being on the call.
"
Person0,"We will get together next year and put a wrap on 2016.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
