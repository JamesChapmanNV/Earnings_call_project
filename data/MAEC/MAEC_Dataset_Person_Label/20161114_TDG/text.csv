Person0,"The commercial transport growth, if you look at mid to high single-digit next year, the commercial transport growth we would expect to be higher, or higher than the average, same thing.
"
Person0,"If you take the business jet, business jet, and I suspect the freighter, they will be a little bit of a down drag.
"
Person0,"So take whatever number you want to use from mid to high single digits.
"
Person0,"The commercial transport is probably on the upper end of that point and the others are down on the lower end.
"
Person0,"I don't think so.
"
Person0,"I think it's going to change versus the intrinsic demand, not just some trick in the comp.
"
Person0,"Yes, I would say you can almost generally go through, now we do it unit by unit, product line by product line.
"
Person0,"So it bounces around.
"
Person0,"But the way I would think about it is almost take the growth in RPMs by region of the world and that will give you some pretty good idea.
"
Person1,"I think it would be, I'm just doing here --
"
Person1,"It's $650 million to 700 million.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Well, the aftermarket shipments were sequentially up.
"
Person0,"The bookings I don't, I just don't have a good, I'd say the same -- I can't say they're noticeably separated.
"
Person0,"We're awfully close on the year, and I think the fourth quarter isn't much different.
"
Person0,"I suspect that's a high number.
"
Person0,"We underspent against our budget the previous year, and I expect that's a little high.
"
Person1,"Our restricted payment is, we can go up to 7.25 net and 4.25 on secured debt capacity, for new debt, plus the including the target of that.
"
Person0,"Are you after how much dividend can we pay out.
"
Person0,"Is that what you're after.
"
Person1,"At this point in time, we only have about $130 million remaining on it through the end of the year.
"
Person1,"And we would have to get an amendment to do any more additional dividend.
"
Person0,"Which, by the way, just so you know, almost every time we do this, you have to get an amendment.
"
Person1,"Or the other point is if we get under six times net debt, we can pay a dividend up to that six times.
"
Person0,"Oh, I think it would be, it's hard to say exactly what the point is when your concern gets to that.
"
Person0,"It's a little bit of an art, rather than a science.
"
Person0,"But clearly starting to see more announcement of turn down of rates in either predictions of turn downs in FY18 or even the beginning of FY19 would do it.
"
Person0,"Now sometimes, you don't see the announcements.
"
Person0,"No one announces it, but you all of a sudden see the orders are starting to slow down.
"
Person0,"That's another thing that would do it.
"
Person0,"And we'll just watch those as the year goes through.
"
Person0,"We're quite, we're prepared, and as we've done in the past, we'll move quick to stay out ahead of this.
"
Person0,"Oh, I think that is materially very close.
"
Person0,"Why we hedge a little bit is there's no guarantee that if someone makes a change, they send us an e-mail and tell us they changed it.
"
Person0,"But we have a pretty good bead on it.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Like everyone in the industry, Boeing has been pressing on what they call this partnership for success, which is at least to roll into less contracts, I would say.
"
Person0,"And we ended up about two or three years ago with a modified version of that, where the terms and conditions we agreed to generically and the rest of it is more product by product focused.
"
Person0,"I don't know.
"
Person0,"It was behind us two years ago, but the contract runs for five years, or maybe it was three years ago, or two years ago.
"
Person0,"I can't remember now.
"
Person0,"But the contract runs for five years, so you'll reengage again a couple years before the contract runs out.
"
Person0,"No, we have not.
"
Person0,"We have not.
"
Person0,"As always, we hear talk about it periodically, but we haven't seen any significant activity, at least for any of the proprietary.
"
Person0,"A very small percent of our business is non-proprietary, and that part of it, you see it.
"
Person0,"It's not unusual to see it.
"
Person0,"Primarily, we own the IP, and it is a very expensive switching process.
"
Person0,"It's long and expensive.
"
Person0,"The main way you protect yourself is deliver quality product, deliver it on time, and service the heck out of the account and fix it fast, if something comes up.
"
Person0,"Because the math rarely works, because of the switching cost.
"
Person0,"I doubt -- first, I have no idea, but that's not going to stop me from saying something, but I want to lead with that I have no idea -- I'd be surprised if it has much impact on worldwide revenue passenger miles.
"
Person0,"But I guess you might see more defense spending, perhaps.
"
Person0,"But I have no way to know how to handicap that at this point.
"
Person0,"I would say they're more small to mid than large.
"
Person0,"But I would also say that's almost always the case.
"
Person0,"The bigger ones tend to, somebody decides to sell them and they come up and you've got to move pretty quick on them.
"
Person0,"I would say the backlog doesn't look a lot different than it often looks.
"
Person0,"Well, when I say the backlog of things we're looking at, if it's not proprietary and doesn't have a reasonable amount of aftermarket, it's not in our backlog.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Well, yes, <UNK>, what I was trying to point out there is the bookings ran behind the revenues this year, FY16.
"
Person0,"So what I was trying to point out is that I don't think that's indicative of FY17, because there were a few big orders placed in FY15 that were multi-year orders.
"
Person0,"So they don't repeat each year, they repeat every other year or every third year, something like that.
"
Person0,"I don't know if that's clear or not.
"
Person0,"I was trying to point out what the rationale was for the bookings running behind.
"
Person0,"It's more like they're long cycle programs.
"
Person0,"I would say the only one that I would say that could is you pays your money and takes your choice on what the A400 shipping rate is going to be.
"
Person0,"That was one of them.
"
Person0,"And you know, there could well be up or down adjustments to that.
"
Person0,"As you know, it's been running in fits and starts.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, if the question is could it be higher.
"
Person0,"Yes, it surely could.
"
Person0,"And I would hope it would be.
"
Person0,"But we have to take our best estimate based on what we get out of the product teams, what we see in our incoming booking rates, and forecast it out.
"
Person0,"Now I would doubt we'd be very far off on the OEM programs, but what could easily move up or down -- I would hope up, not down -- is the aftermarket.
"
Person0,"If you get more active or you just decide to restock, those things can move pretty quickly.
"
