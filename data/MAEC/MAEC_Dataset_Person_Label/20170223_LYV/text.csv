Person0,"And, also, just to add to that.
"
Person0,"We kind of get a little US centric here.
"
Person0,"We've been very effective on a global basis, of moving faster than the historic Ticketmaster that we inherited did here.
"
Person0,"So, in the UK, Australia, all across Europe, where we have launched a secondary platform, we are number one, close to number one, I mean, StubHub really is only strong in America.
"
Person0,"They are obviously expanding.
"
Person0,"But we, on a global basis, we're seeing great success as we're either a leader, or an early entrant into a lot of the markets.
"
Person0,"So, we see on a global basis we will continue to have market share growth on that segment.
"
Person1,"A lot of that is part of the deferred revenue at year end.
"
Person1,"So, they've sold for future shows as well, so the reason why we say we don't repatriate is we use for their events, and pay artists, et cetera.
"
Person1,"I'm sorry.
"
Person1,"Yes, it is going to be primarily deferred, sponsorship, all kinds of things.
"
Person1,"We don't have more granularity to give you on that.
"
Person1,"But generally, our cash is going to tick up with the deferred revenue.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I would say, where I think StubHub has always had market leadership in the US, I think we've obviously grown strong and taken market share from the independents in the US.
"
Person0,"Outside of America, Viagogo and others have been out there, and we would be the one taking market share from most of the independents in different countries.
"
Person0,"No, we haven't seen that.
"
Person0,"We have a strong 2016 in Europe, obviously and international.
"
Person0,"And, we're off in February to a strong on-sale, right now across Europe.
"
Person0,"We don't see any slowdown in any countries, right now.
"
Person0,"We see very robust planned and on-sale, so far.
"
Person0,"That's all, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"(laughter)
"
Person0,"We've been talking for the last couple years about an API open allocated market.
"
Person0,"We've been very clear that the rest of the world has always been allocation, and Ticketmaster does very well in those markets.
"
Person0,"We've got a strong market leadership, generally at a lower cost per ticket.
"
Person0,"We've seen over the years, that eventually we always had kind of stated that we thought that multiple -- more distribution points were going to be a reality in the business for clients.
"
Person0,"While we were very aggressive over the last three years of building an API to help clients and artists, et cetera, have opportunity like StubHub -- or Spotify, Bandsintown, Groupons, and others.
"
Person0,"We believe that the smartest strategy for Ticketmaster as a software platform, has always been to solve its clients' needs to provide great platform software, provide a great marketplace, and provide the flexibility to use partner sites to help augment its sales.
"
Person0,"Because, as you know, when you have as many customers as we do, you're the hottest team in the NBA, you're not that worried about partner sites.
"
Person0,"You're not really worried about Amazon if your U2 sold a million tickets in an hour.
"
Person0,"But if you're a team or an artist, that's like most of the business, needs to sell a few extra tickets, you are always going to be looking for incremental distribution points.
"
Person0,"So we've always believed that being open API driven, letting our clients have opportunity to power other retail sites is a smart strategy for Ticketmaster, and we've been doing that over the last couple of years now -- finding partner sites to augment sales.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We see them as retail partner, absolutely.
"
Person1,"On the CapEx question, think about it from a new tools or new clients, versus other things.
"
Person1,"So if we are adding technology to our mobile product, or adding functionality to TM+, those things would be revenue generating.
"
Person1,"If we get a new client where we have to add hardware or make some changes, that's going to be revenue generating.
"
Person1,"Other things, like your question on CapEx related to cloud -- moving to the cloud, or just replacing hardware, et cetera would generally be maintenance.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"If we're adding new technology and new tools to it, absolutely.
