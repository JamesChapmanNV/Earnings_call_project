Person1,"For Susquehanna -- Bank of <UNK>tucky really doesn't have a huge amount of purchase accounting, so I'll just deal with mainly Susquehanna.
"
Person1,"I would say that, with the credit mark that we have, which is about 4.5%, there will be approximately a little under $600 million of accretable purchase accounting income that basically goes through net interest income, over the life of the assets.
"
Person1,"At the same time, though, we will have more loans that we take losses on, and those loans will increase provision.
"
Person1,"And the timing won't necessarily match up.
"
Person1,"It's too early to say what the losses will be in the Susquehanna portfolio.
"
Person1,"But know that we pretty much locked down the $580 million over the life of the assets, so call that five-plus years.
"
Person1,"But it would be more earlier on, and then it would tail off towards the end of the five-year period.
"
Person1,"And the losses could be sporadic over that same time period.
"
Person1,"The other thing to note is, the portfolio Susquehanna has, we're putting it on the books, doesn't have an allowance to it.
"
Person1,"As new volume comes on from Susquehanna, we have to provide for an allowance there.
"
Person1,"So that's why we are talking about potential growth impact, also, of that portfolio on the provision.
"
Person1,"We have higher deposit balances, so our clients are carrying larger balances now on hand, which just means they pay less in fees, and just more with compensating balances.
"
Person0,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, <UNK>, I suppose between some of the commentary you heard, I would be where I have been, which is in the middle of the road.
"
Person0,"I think the economy is in a really solid 2% to 5% -- I mean 2% to 2.5% real GDP growth.
"
Person0,"I see very little risk of any downside on that.
"
Person0,"I see very little opportunity for it being substantially better than that, until we get closer to the 2016 election.
"
Person0,"No if you get some real positive leadership intonations out of DC, then there is some upside opportunity.
"
Person0,"But for the next 12 months, I think you can be pretty solidly focused on 2% to 2.5%, which is actually pretty good.
"
Person0,"Because you know, that's nominal at about 4.5% or 5%, in terms of the nation as a whole.
"
Person0,"I think the Southeast, <UNK>, can probably beat that a tad.
"
Person0,"Because as you know, as you and I have talked about over the years, the Southeast clearly took it on the chin.
"
Person0,"But -- and everything got devalued.
"
Person0,"But it has been -- values have been reset.
"
Person0,"Activity flows are moving.
"
Person0,"Florida's back to growing 800 people a day, including Texas, 1,000 people a day.
"
Person0,"But Atlanta's turned, finally, and the coastal markets of North Carolina have turned.
"
Person0,"So I'd say the Southeast will be net positive to the national growth rate.
"
Person0,"Not dramatically, but if the national is, say, 2.5%, I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see the Southeast at 3.5%.
"
Person0,"I think it will be steady to slightly up.
"
Person0,"The refinance, it is the last of that, I think, as of some dramatic international events.
"
Person0,"But look, purchase activity is really picking up.
"
Person0,"New home construction is up substantially; new home purchases is up.
"
Person0,"We're seeing a shift toward higher percentage of purchases versus re-fis.
"
Person0,"So I think you can think about it in terms of being steady to up -- not dramatic up, but steady to up.
"
Person0,"You bet.
"
