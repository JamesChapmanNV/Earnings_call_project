Person1,"This is one of the biggest and most complex areas, and of course lower interest rates has made this a larger reserve needed.
"
Person1,"As universal life with lifetime secondary guarantees, lower rates have made these contracts to be more valuable to their customers, and therefore, we've had to increase the reserves on them.
"
Person1,"Well, we are seeing less people annuitize.
"
Person1,"If you annuitize, you don't pick dollar-for-dollar.
"
Person1,"So less people annuitize, more people pick dollar-for-dollar.
"
Person1,"But the actuarial calculations are highly complex.
"
Person1,"We run tens of thousands of runs over a wide range of scenarios.
"
Person1,"So when we talk about these interest rates, these are the average interest rates, both even in stat and GAAP.
"
Person1,"It's just the mean of those interest rates in stat reverts to roughly this 4.25% in 2027, whereas the GAAP piece, if you pick dollar-for-dollar a piece of your risk, the guaranteed piece, the certain period of your annuity, has to be reserved under GAAP using a mean reversion interest rate of 1.36%, and that's a very wide difference, including your separate account returns.
"
Person1,"And I want to stress, that's a separate account return before fees.
"
Person1,"So you generally having negative returns in your separate accounts, so you can see how that can have a high cost to this.
"
Person1,"If interest rates migrate higher, and you have to mark this every quarter to the current yield curve.
"
Person1,"So if interest rates go up, this charge becomes less, as you go through time.
"
Person1,"So we also wanted to give you the wide range of the changes, because what the ultimate cost of these things will be will depend on interest rates and what policyholders do.
"
Person1,"I would also like to stress, this is over a long period of time.
"
Person1,"Our average age of these contracts is in the 60s, and people will elect these options well into their 80s and higher.
"
Person1,"So these are long-term contracts, and how this works out over time will be the ultimate cost.
"
Person1,"But we do match this to our experience, and we do it on a regular basis, as we get credible experience, and we now have a new industry study that we just got that had some good credible experience for GMIBs, and that's why we set our reserves appropriately.
