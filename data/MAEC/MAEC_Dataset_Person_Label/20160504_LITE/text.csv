Person1,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Yes, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"So we don't really sell a lot to the supercomputer market, so we are not impacted by that situation.
"
Person1,"Yes, I'll take the revenue one and let <UNK> take the OpEx one.
"
Person1,"I'd say that on the revenue front, I would say that you could kind of look at last quarter as a 13.5 real quarter -- 13.5 week real quarter, in that we probably lost half of the production of one week.
"
Person1,"Because all of our production is not in China, some of it is in Thailand.
"
Person1,"So I would say that, given that we were hand-to-mouth throughout the quarter, we didn't have the ability to build up inventory and ship it during that timeframe.
"
Person1,"So we lost probably half a week.
"
Person1,"So you can say it's a 3% increase on a normal quarter if you want to try to normalize what we are looking forward to in the June quarter.
"
Person1,"Yes, I'd say that we are really not impacted from a supply standpoint from Golden Week, as we don't have any production in Japan.
"
Person1,"From a demand standpoint, the Japanese customers probably slow down a little bit, but we've got plenty of demand to make up for that.
"
Person1,"So I'd say that we're really not impacted by Golden Week this quarter.
"
Person2,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"On your question on --
"
Person1,"Did that answer your question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"And then to follow up on your question on OpEx, so the OpEx for the extra week was almost $2 million for the quarter.
"
Person2,"Going into Q4, that will drop off.
"
Person2,"And then we have some other puts and takes.
"
Person1,"Great.
"
Person1,"Thank you, operator.
"
Person1,"You know, the Lumentum team is excited to support our customers, grow our business, and create value for our shareholders.
"
Person1,"I want to thank our employees for all their hard work that has put us in this excellent position in the market.
"
Person1,"We see strong market demand from our customers.
"
Person1,"Our new products, including TrueFlex ROADMs and 100G Datacom transceivers are winning in the market, and position us well as we look forward.
"
Person1,"I believe we are in the early stages of a worldwide bandwidth expansion, making the future bright at Lumentum.
"
Person1,"We will be discussing our business at several Investor Relations events in the coming weeks.
"
Person1,"These events are listed on our website in the Investor Relations section.
"
Person1,"This concludes our call for today.
"
Person1,"We would like to thank everyone for attending, and we look forward to talking to you again in another three months.
