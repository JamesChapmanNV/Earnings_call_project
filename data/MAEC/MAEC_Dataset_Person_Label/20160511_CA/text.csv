Person,Sentence
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"I believe the first part of your question is what do we believe the margin impact was for Rally, and it was approximately 1 point.
"
Person2,"So, we were able to, as <UNK> said earlier, a lot of the good work that has been done inside of development is that reprioritizing, and we were able to reprioritize that.
"
Person2,"The second part of your question -- if you could repeat it because you were also a little bit choppy, please.
"
Person2,"As you know, we don't give guidance out by segment, but what we can tell you is as we work through what we had said back on Analyst day is they would lose money last year and they would be breakeven this year.
"
Person2,"So, you can figure that out that you'll have a benefit in the ES segment going into this year.
"
Person2,"We've already worked out the fact that they will be breakeven throughout the course of this year, and then, they will just improve from there.
"
Person2,"Xceedium continued to do well.
"
Person2,"As <UNK> had said, right on track with the business case, in fact ahead of the business case.
"
Person2,"We were very happy with how they performed in the quarter and for the year and the buildout of their pipeline that we see, and we're just now starting to get started in places like Europe so that's a very bright product for us.
"
Person1,"Sure, on the organic sales for the year, we're up.
"
Person1,"It was just for the quarter that they were down so we're pretty impressed with our ability to sell these new solutions and some of the existing solutions we've had for a while in an organic fashion.
"
Person1,"This is actually a bright spot for us.
"
Person2,"We grew with the market in our organic business for the full year.
"
Person2,"Actually, there's a lot of things that are going on inside CA.
"
Person2,"Some I'll talk about and some <UNK> will talk about.
"
Person2,"But, a lot of what we're doing with our customers when we have a whole group of people to make sure the good customer satisfaction is going on.
"
Person2,"The second part of that is we've done a lot of reaching out to customers who were dissatisfied to find out why they were dissatisfied.
"
Person2,"And, what we find with that is that it sometimes had to do with their install.
"
Person2,"How it was installed.
"
Person2,"Did they even install it.
"
Person2,"By coming back around with them later on what we're seeing is a better uptick in our renewals.
"
Person2,"If you noticed this quarter, we had a mid-90% renewal which is a very strong renewal quarter.
"
Person2,"And, for the year on average of those four quarters, we were around 90%.
"
Person2,"So, as long as we continue to see that track that way -- as long as a lot of things <UNK> talked about earlier -- your ability to install continue.
"
Person2,"We believe that we'll continue to have the renewal yields stay up in that range, and as long as we grow with the market like we talked about back in November, we think we'll be on track.
"
Person1,"This whole notion of customer experience is something that the Company has completely adopted, and it goes way past just what's happening on the product space.
"
Person1,"For example, we have a team that goes through that is not in development and/or sales crawling back into some of our customers in the finance organization, in the HR organization just polling customers to see what they think of CA and what they could do following the net promoter score algorithm.
"
Person1,"We're also making sure that for every single customer that calls the help desk especially with a high severity issue that they are getting turnaround time in four hours.
"
Person1,"Our net promoter score has gone up each and every quarter for the last seven quarters since we've been tracking it.
"
Person1,"The whole Company focused on this is making a big difference.
"
Person1,"On the development side, we separated a full group out that's called customer experience and what they are doing is reviewing all of the user design as well as the usability of the product, of new Product Development.
"
Person1,"So, having a centralized group making sure that a product that gets put into the market is easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to install, I think is going to have a lot of dividends going forward.
"
Person1,"And, we see for what that group has been able to do so far, we're very impressed.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you again for joining us this afternoon.
"
Person1,"I'd like to leave you with a few takeaways.
"
Person1,"First, we delivered very solid FY16 results with most of our performance metrics coming in line or above the high end of our guidance.
"
Person1,"Q4 revenue for the first time on the top line has grown in nearly four years, and we expect to cross into modest growth in FY17.
"
Person1,"We are making very good progress in our journey to drive the long-term, sustainable growth as we continue to manage the Business with thoughtful discipline and do what's in the best interest of our customers, shareholders, employees for the long term.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much.
"
