Person0,"I think there is a whole host of different decisions.
"
Person0,"Staff turnover is one.
"
Person0,"The whole inflection of the industry as -- whatever I said is if you have a dozen or 20 retailers you are working with, and those retailers aren't changing and evolving and you're not adding new retailers, there's probably going to be -- that's going to be a tough sales cycle.
"
Person0,"We can talk about the 50% to 75% lower total cost of ownership, but it's working -- they've got other priorities.
"
Person0,"So, when their environment is changing, their retailers are asking for more.
"
Person0,"Oftentimes, we're moving in and taking a piece of the business, because they just can't onboard and make the changes for their retailers fast enough.
"
Person0,"So that's an opportunity.
"
Person0,"If they are changing ERP systems, so that's where channel is important, that's an automatic that you are going to re-look how you are doing that.
"
Person0,"And I think it is -- it's educating them on the alternatives, so when and if they are interested in making a move, that we're top of mind.
"
Person0,"So I think there's a whole host of reasons.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So as it relates to EBITDA, we set what the expectations are for the year.
"
Person1,"And then we take the opportunity to -- if we are ahead, for example, we will take that opportunity to invest more back in the business, to keep on growing the business.
"
Person1,"And so really our philosophy has not changed.
"
Person1,"We hold ourselves to an EBITDA number for the year, and that has remained consistent.
"
Person1,"So the fact that we're slightly ahead in Q3 is why Q4 comes down slightly.
"
Person1,"We are remaining the same in what we have said all year, as it relates to the high end of EBITDA guidance.
"
Person0,"Yes, so, our acquisition strategy has remained relatively constant since 2010.
"
Person0,"We believe we can accomplish our long-term goals through organic growth, and so we are primarily focused on organic growth.
"
Person0,"Having said that, we have $135 million of cash and marketable securities, so we're always out looking.
"
Person0,"But what we're looking for are high-quality companies that fit right in our sweet spot.
"
Person0,"So all three of the acquisitions we've made since we became a public company, there was no change in the direction or the strategy of the business, and that we think that can help us accelerate or maintain our 20%-plus recurring revenue growth.
"
Person0,"So we're going to continue to be very focused on organic growth, and look for opportunity as it's out there.
"
Person0,"It's a very fragmented market.
"
Person0,"And we go after five primary markets, and they're all very meaningful to us.
"
Person0,"As we had mentioned, we have over 400 partners, and I think it's just a continual journey for channels.
"
Person0,"And they've executed in the past, and continue to execute as adding new partners and expanding the relationship with the existing partners.
"
Person0,"And I think you're going to see a long-term general trend of that.
"
Person0,"We have been very marginal on any price increases.
"
Person0,"And we'll continue to do small things here and there, but we don't see any drastic price changes in at least the coming few years.
"
Person0,"Again, we've done some things where we'll -- maybe a few percentage points and that, but nothing drastic at this time.
"
Person0,"We do think, long-term, as we become larger and larger and as we continue to add more value to our customers, I think that opportunity is out there.
"
Person1,"It's still less than 20% of retailers that are sharing that data.
"
Person1,"So that's also part of the reason why we believe this is a long-term opportunity for us, that we'll get the benefit from it for many years to come.
"
Person1,"But there has not been an inflection point as it relates to retailers sharing the data.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So, it's been pretty consistent around about that year-and-a-half, on average, breakeven.
"
Person1,"We've been at that point for the last couple of years.
"
Person1,"It was a little bit longer, prior to that.
"
