Person,Sentence
Person1,"Thanks for the questions.
"
Person1,"I will take the first one, then hand off to Al for the second part.
"
Person1,"With respect to our comp sales, obviously the trends over the last couple of years have been difficult.
"
Person1,"And we've put a lot of good solid initiatives in place to turn things around.
"
Person1,"We are not there yet on positive.
"
Person1,"We'd love to get there as quickly as possible.
"
Person1,"We are first doing the things necessary to make improvements such as we think the gift department -- so there's a new selection of product.
"
Person1,"That will start hitting our stores probably late summer and early fall.
"
Person1,"So I think that will be exciting for us to see.
"
Person1,"Toys and games business has been a good performer for us and now we're seeing a little bit of upside given the market conditions in that business.
"
Person1,"So, there are parts of the business that have turned positive, but we can't specifically state when the entire business will turn just yet.
"
Person1,"So obviously that's metric number one for us and we're very focused on it.
"
Person2,"On the second part of your question on the buybacks, as you know, the Board declared a dividend last week.
"
Person2,"We regularly review with the Board the best way to return value to shareholders while maintaining flexibility to run the day-to-day business.
"
Person2,"So, I can assure you that we look at both dividends and buybacks as options and deploying capital and returning the highest value to our shareholders.
"
Person1,"Al, if I could just add to that.
"
Person1,"I think clearly that's the balance that we are trying to strike.
"
Person1,"And truthfully, we've had a lot of things to correct before really needing investment dollars just yet.
"
Person1,"So, for instance, the new store prototypes are smaller, we think more efficient and we think they will work beautifully.
"
Person1,"Obviously we've got to prove that out.
"
Person1,"In addition to that, given that our entire fleet is bigger, we want to take the learnings and takeaways from the smaller stores and redeploy those, reintroduce those into the chain.
"
Person1,"So once we have a model that we feel great about we can think about deploying capital to that much more quickly.
"
Person1,"And I think we are all on the same page and ready to do that as it rolls out.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"And thank you all for joining us on today's call and for your interest in support of Barnes & Noble.
"
Person0,"Our first-quarter earnings release will be released on or about September 6.
"
Person0,"We look forward to speaking with you then.
"
Person0,"Thank you and have a good day.
"
