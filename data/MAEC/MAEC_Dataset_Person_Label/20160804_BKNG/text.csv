Person0,"I think we like our model compared to the other models out there.
"
Person0,"We have a scale customer base that is used to doing business with us on these terms.
"
Person0,"And I think we are doing a good job of building relationships and the business processes and the automation to enable us to deliver the experience to the user when they are booking a non-hotel accommodation or a property that is not being managed by a professional owner.
"
Person0,"So we like that business model; we like that hand of cards that we have been dealt.
"
Person0,"I think that HomeAway's customer base and their owners are chafing a little bit at substantial increase in fees.
"
Person0,"And ultimately in a competitive marketplace for these types of properties, consumers have been shopping around for hotels for 15, 17 years now.
"
Person0,"And it is probably the case that over time they will shop around for vacation rentals.
"
Person0,"And ultimately it will be about finding the best value.
"
Person0,"And I am hopeful that we will be able to provide the best value.
"
Person0,"I am not going to get into a conversation about if they do this will you do that.
"
Person0,"That is between us and the hotels.
"
Person0,"And judging by the questions I just want to underscore that we have great long-term relationships with the hotel chains.
"
Person0,"We have been in business with them since I started in the business in 2000.
"
Person0,"And I would expect those relationships to continue to be strong.
"
Person0,"And we provide a lot of business for the hotel chains and we provide business in languages and in destinations that it is hard for them to access directly.
"
Person0,"But we have a unique benefit that we provide and we absolutely value the inventory that we are getting from our partners here.
"
Person0,"So, I wouldn't express it as if they do this we will do that kind of a situation.
"
Person0,"This is a partnership.
"
Person1,"On the first question, <UNK>, we have seen some relative strength in the South.
"
Person1,"Spain and Portugal have been very strong markets.
"
Person1,"Turkey has not, Turkey has been an impaired market between terrorist attacks and then the attempted coup.
"
Person1,"Some of the other markets that have been strong like Ireland and Germany.
"
Person1,"So people shying away from some of the markets where terrorist attacks have been taking place in the past and where maybe they have more of a fear of safety for traveling there at the moment.
"
Person0,"And, <UNK>, I wouldn't -- there is nothing that we can see from our results that indicates a major trend of corporations pulling back travel because of safety concerns.
"
Person0,"I am certain there are some business travelers who have canceled trips in the immediate aftermath of some of these events.
"
Person0,"But broadly speaking a major pullback is at least not obvious in the numbers we are looking at.
"
Person1,"Well, Spanish ADRs have been very strong, so all of that demand shifting there is actually having a positive impact on the ADRs in those markets.
"
Person1,"And overall you can see our ADR trend has been roughly stable, down slightly less than a percent.
"
Person1,"So nothing really to call out there.
"
Person0,"So, KAYAK has had a good run of performance here this year.
"
Person0,"They have done a very nice job of not only building query demand in the United States and elsewhere, but they are doing also a good job of continually innovating with respect to their product and with respect to mobile in particular, which helps with the flow-through of the economics.
"
Person0,"So, they are doing a very nice job.
"
Person0,"And their international expansion continues.
"
Person0,"I don't have anything to tell you particularly about this market or that market, but KAYAK continues to I would say in a measured way build its footprint internationally.
"
Person1,"We don't see any major impact one way or the other on that event, so we didn't call anything out, we didn't build anything specifically in there.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, the CEO search continues and the normal way with a committee of our Board and a recruiting firm and they are right in the middle of it.
"
Person0,"Thank you all very much for participating in the call.
