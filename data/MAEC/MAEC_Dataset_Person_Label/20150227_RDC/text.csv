Person0,"That's a good question and there's a lot of discussion on that around here.
"
Person0,"There's a lot of opportunities.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, the answer to that is that we consider all opportunities and we think about them and a few parameters around it.
"
Person0,"Asset prices for an asset that has not got a contract have to be at attractive levels and for assets we would be interested in, we're not at those levels, we're not at that price level as yet.
"
Person0,"If there is an opportunity to put something onto a longer term contract, we would certainly look at it, but we haven't managed to realize any of those in this market, as you would probably have guessed.
"
Person0,"So I feel given where the asset prices are, they're not low enough yet.
"
Person0,"Also, we do value our investment grade credit rating and we just need to make sure that we balance how we feel about the market going forward and the price of the asset.
"
Person0,"I would say, though, the concept of buying some high-quality distressed assets is something take we find attractive, but we won't be moving on it until the parameters are in line and I don't see that being any time in the short term.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, I think it needs come down a chunk more where it is.
"
Person0,"We see so many different opportunities, but it needs to come down somewhat.
"
Person0,"Something vague, right, but we're not at the levels where it would be attractive yet.
"
Person0,"Given the outlook we see in front of us.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, we're always evaluating every opportunity and as you probably guessed, we're not short of people bringing us ideas; however, we wouldn't comment on anything specifically on M&A.
"
Person0,"I would say that I would be pretty surprised to see some M&A at this point with a considerable cash component, given that we've seen a number of contractors cutting their dividend.
"
Person2,"That's spot on.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Appreciate it.
"
