Person0,"Good morning, Walt.
"
Person0,"I'll just make a couple of high-level comments.
"
Person0,"The overall Vention business was put together through a series of acquisitions, some more focused on, I'd say, the service side of the business and some more focused on sort of the technology side of the business.
"
Person0,"And the owners in the process decided to split this up into sort of two pieces.
"
Person0,"And as we said before, we like the position where you have the opportunity to be a solutions provided to a customer where you've got differentiated capability, and we certainly so that in the Vention AT business, and that's why we were most interested in that particular business.
"
Person0,"There will be a modest ongoing relationship between the two businesses and contracts to cover that, but it's not significant in terms of the total.
"
Person0,"So they operated as fairly independent businesses.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"There's some products that go back and forth.
"
Person0,"It's a very de minimis amount and we will have agreements in place to address those, but it's not significant.
"
Person0,"As <UNK> had mentioned, there's certain capabilities with each of these sites that are important, and, quite frankly, the locations are important from a medical device, particularly front end design standpoint.
"
Person0,"So we really like the locations that we have and the presence we have in sort of the hotbed markets of the medical design space.
"
Person0,"I would say we're encouraged by the activity that we see in terms of the opportunities.
"
Person0,"I'd say we're finally starting to see some of the excrusion, the film part of the business, pick up and that shows up most in our dies business which is looking better.
"
Person0,"I'd say the injection molding part of the business has been on a strong run up until about six to nine months ago where it's slow down a little bit.
"
Person0,"I'd say that part is continuing.
"
Person0,"So I'd say we expect this to be a positive year from a growth perspective, but a lot of these are bigger projects.
"
Person0,"We're working on them now.
"
Person0,"They need to come through to have an impact in the year.
"
Person0,"But I'd say we're encouraged by what we're seeing from an opportunity standpoint, but it's on everything working in concert, much like the [Kwerties] business where we've got a couple parts of the business looking pretty attractive and other parts up against tougher comps and not quite as attractive right now.
"
Person0,"But, again, anything that's really more consumer non-durable-related is looking pretty strong and the durable piece is, I'd say, at a good level but not as strong as we might have seen in parts of last year.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
