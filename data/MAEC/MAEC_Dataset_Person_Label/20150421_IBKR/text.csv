Person0,"It's sophisticated options traders' accounts that have been moved over to us completely.
"
Person0,"Those accounts are with us, and they do everything in that account.
"
Person0,"What they needed was the ability to execute complex trades.
"
Person0,"And instead of building the system themselves, they rather chose us to do this for them.
"
Person0,"But since these accounts also need to have stock often, and stock is often a part of the trade, the entire account is with us.
"
Person0,"Now, it's 1,000 accounts that came over so far, but there are about another several thousand still in the queue.
"
Person0,"Also in the future, these kinds of accounts for sophisticated option traders will be open with us when they come to Scottrade to open a new account.
"
Person0,"No, we're not paying them anything.
"
Person0,"They are paying us.
"
Person0,"So say if you -- for the first 10,000 option contracts, if you come to us directly, we charge you $0.75 a contract.
"
Person0,"But if you trade over, I think, 100,000 contracts, we charge you $0.15 a contract.
"
Person0,"So all the Scottrade accounts are looked at as though they were one account, so they get the benefit of these volume tiers.
"
Person0,"It's a fully disclosed account, but for purposes of charging commission, we use them all as though they were an omnibus account.
"
Person1,"Difficult in a short few sentences, but it's -- I think, suffice to say that the customer losses all occurred in our US broker dealer Interactive Brokers LLC.
"
Person1,"Therefore, they would be subject ultimately to US rates, and not to anything complicated, because they're not in foreign markets.
"
Person0,"I think I said the last earnings call that I'm thinking about selling small amounts, like 1 million shares of [Clorice] dollar are up.
"
Person0,"So by this time, the stock is up by $350.
"
Person0,"I may be out.
"
Person0,"Not yet.
"
Person0,"Haven't reached that level yet.
"
Person0,"That's right.
"
Person0,"It's reasonable if you look at the end of 2016, yes.
"
Person0,"The last quarter of 2016.
"
Person1,"That's kind of what I'm looking at.
"
Person1,"Late Q3, Q4 of 2016.
"
Person0,"Well, we have a team of service people around the globe, roughly 35 of them.
"
Person0,"And their task is to approach other brokers, hedge funds and investment advisers and prop traders.
"
Person0,"These are the four classes of clientele that we are marketing to.
"
Person0,"And we also -- as there is more and more publicity about the various things we do, they often receive calls.
"
Person0,"The conversation with one of our sales force at Scottrade has been going on for, I think, about a year and a half, before they actually decided on doing this.
"
Person0,"You see the next idea that we're thinking about trying to get them into, is offering futures, because they do not offer futures trading right now.
"
Person0,"As we transfer all the [optery offense or though] the options accounts, maybe we'll think about talking to them about futures and currencies.
"
Person0,"The 3 million accounts mostly are small stock traders, and they are just as well being where they are.
"
Person0,"I don't think the mix has changed that quickly.
"
Person0,"It's probably the same mix going forward.
"
Person0,"Our task is to make our platform good enough for them to say to themselves that we can offer a better service if we offer Interactive Brokers' platform, and we just do the hand-holding.
"
Person0,"That's where we would like to get to.
"
Person0,"And it's difficult to maintain.
"
Person0,"It's not only the technology also the back office and the regulations, they are getting more and more complex.
"
Person0,"So I don't think that a smaller outfits can afford the expense of keeping it up-to-date.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"It's better technology, better sales, we are better known.
"
Person0,"Two years ago, whenever we approached a potential client, they said -- Interactive Brokers, who is that.
"
Person0,"We've never heard of them.
"
Person0,"Now that's no longer the case.
"
Person0,"The longer we have this, the better it will go, I think.
"
Person0,"No.
"
