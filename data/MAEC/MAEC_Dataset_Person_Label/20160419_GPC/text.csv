Person2,"Welcome.
"
Person1,"Well, my understanding of the question on the trends was more product oriented.
"
Person1,"And that's where I think we have stabilized in particular product categories.
"
Person1,"In terms of the impact of Easter, we should see the benefit of that in April.
"
Person1,"We should pick up a little bit more in April that we gave back in March.
"
Person1,"Well, we'll see how it all shakes out, and we'll give you an update on it in our second quarter conference call.
"
Person3,"So you're correct, when we look at gross margin, the other three segments are fine.
"
Person3,"The pressure on gross margin was through Industrial, and so a lot of our initiatives are in place.
"
Person3,"And I should mention, Industrial has done a really good job.
"
Person3,"Their core gross profit was up in Q4, and was also up in Q1.
"
Person3,"So they've done a lot of things on the buy side and sell side to help get that up.
"
Person3,"So when the volume does come back, and it probably needs to be more in the very low single-digit range for us to get some of that volume incentive back, that's going to really go straight to the margin.
"
Person3,"So the good thing is, they're SG&A improvements and they're core gross profit, those things are already in place.
"
Person3,"And when we do get just a little bit of volume back in the top line growth, then we'll see that on their operating margins.
"
Person3,"Thank you.
"
Person3,"Hello, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"So all of our businesses have initiatives in the working capital, and specifically focused in the payables area.
"
Person3,"So while I would say just more of the majority of the dollars are coming from Automotive, we do have improvement coming from the others.
"
Person3,"And I can tell you their teams, it's baked into our pay plans, it's part of all -- everybody's performance.
"
Person3,"It's part of what everybody is pushing down, is working capital initiatives.
"
Person3,"And we are seeing some improvements in the non-automotive as well.
"
Person3,"So the idea is that we have just continued improvements each quarter.
"
Person3,"But again, it's more coming from Automotive, but we're getting some of from the others too.
"
Person2,"Yes, <UNK>, so I'll answer that two ways.
"
Person2,"On the brakes business, our brakes business has been solid now for a number of quarters in a row, and that's across all the brakes.
"
Person2,"So that's rotors and friction and calipers have been all outpacing our overall growth.
"
Person2,"And I think it's just a great job by our team out in the field grabbing some market share, and we got a great partner on that side.
"
Person2,"If you will recall, <UNK>, a year ago on the chassis side, we were having some significant service issues.
"
Person2,"And pleased to report those are now behind us, and we're seeing that business return back to more normal growth rates.
"
Person2,"But we were down quite a bit early last year as a result of some of the service problems.
"
Person2,"So again, that's a business we ought to do quite well throughout the first half of the year.
"
Person2,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"We thank you for participating on today's first quarter call, and we appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to updating you in July on our second-quarter results.
"
Person3,"Thank you.
