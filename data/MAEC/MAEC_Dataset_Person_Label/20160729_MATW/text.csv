Person1,"To date, not necessarily.
"
Person1,"Time will tell.
"
Person1,"We've had some slowing in our UK market as we kind of go through this, but not enough to materially change our results.
"
Person1,"Most of the projects we're working on have a longer lead time than the last several weeks.
"
Person1,"So, not yet.
"
Person1,"Let's put it that way.
"
Person1,"As a practical matter, the -- as you all may be aware, the Food Labeling Modernization Act has passed, and the regulations associated with that have been finalized.
"
Person1,"We expect implementation to be [about] 2018, as it currently stands.
"
Person1,"There's some staggered implementation dates based on size.
"
Person1,"So, we should start to see some pickup from that.
"
Person1,"We believe that we've had some hold-back with some of our brands as they get there.
"
Person1,"But, you know <UNK>, if you look at the P&Ls of our largest CPG accounts that we do, they've struggled in their top lines, as well.
"
Person1,"And I think what we're seeing is just containment in their spending on the marketing side, especially as it relates to the packaging as we move forward.
"
Person1,"So, I think that it has more to do with the economy and a sluggish consumer than it does with any changes in their desire to spend on packaging long term.
"
Person1,"So, we think it should be a matter of time.
"
Person1,"We should see those things return to more robust markets, and we're well positioned to take advantage of that.
"
Person1,"No question, the new product release is not necessarily in the fulfillment side.
"
Person1,"If you -- we take a look at some of the automated warehouse literature and statistics out there.
"
Person1,"It's just a bit of a downturn as we go through this.
"
Person1,"Generally, as we approach the Christmas season, people turn off their spending as it relates to [automated] warehouses.
"
Person1,"They do not want to be interrupting their distribution at the time of -- the busiest of their season.
"
Person1,"We expect that to kind of return to normalcy through the first and second quarters of 2017.
"
Person1,"But at the end of the day, right now what we're seeing is a slowing, and we have enough of a lead time to see that it most likely will impact our next quarter there.
"
Person1,"But it is a little bit more of a project-based business, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"And as a result, the projects come and go.
"
Person1,"The timing of those may impact a quarter or two, but generally the direction of that group continues to be the right one.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, we typically don't quantify the specific benefit related to those commodity costs, for various reasons -- we'll leave it at that -- but we did see a benefit this quarter and this year to date compared to last year, not only in bronze but other commodities including fuel, for example.
"
Person0,"I would remind you, <UNK>, given where our size is today relative to historical comparisons, bronze is critical but not overwhelmingly controlling of our results.
"
Person1,"I think we'll start to see work trickling in at that point in time.
"
Person1,"I think 2017 and 2018 will be where we'll see most of that work flow through.
"
Person1,"To be truthful, the FLMA did not go as far as we would have hoped, from a provider standpoint.
"
Person1,"It will require changes to packaging, not as significant that we initially had proposed.
"
Person1,"But it will require a touch on every single package that's out there.
"
Person1,"It's difficult to tell at this point in time.
"
Person1,"We'd rather keep you happy at the end of the quarter.
"
Person1,"But the fact of the matter is we're doing everything we can in the markets that we operate in.
"
Person1,"We've seen a light month of July on the death rate side.
"
Person1,"So, could that come back in the next quarter or two.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"We have a couple of things we're waiting for results on with respect to the fulfillment side that could change a quarter.
"
Person1,"We've got a few things out there that could make it much better or put us right in line with where we expect to be.
"
Person1,"At the end of the day, suffice it to say that the next quarter is not going to make the difference.
"
Person1,"We think the direction of the whole group is going in the right way.
"
Person0,"All right.
"
Person0,"Thank you, John.
"
Person0,"Well, we'd like to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning, and we look forward to our fourth quarter earnings release and conference call in November this year.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
"
