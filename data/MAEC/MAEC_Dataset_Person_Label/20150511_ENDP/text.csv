Person1,"On R&D, it's simply that our expected trial work on frozen shoulder, as well as cellulite is delayed a little bit from our initial assumptions, and that's primarily because on cellulite, we want to have the right dialogue with FDA before we enter into a trial in frozen shoulder, we need to make sure we structure the next trial in a way that optimizes the chances of success.
"
Person1,"All of that being said, in terms of our ultimate expectation of commercial availability of those two indications in 2018, hasn't really changed.
"
Person1,"We'll be able to have a better view on that, once we get to the next trial, and see what the results look like.
"
Person1,"So that, largely speaking, explains some of the lower than expected spend in R&D.
"
Person1,"In SG&A, we're just getting through the integration of Auxilium and sometimes when you go through these types of things, you do slow down spend.
"
Person1,"You want to make sure that you're fully integrated, before you start spending in certain areas.
"
Person1,"So that essentially has moved some expenses into second quarter and the second half.
"
Person1,"So there are a few embedded questions in there.
"
Person1,"Let me see if I can get to at least some of them.
"
Person1,"So with the South African market itself, South Africa being a challenging market doesn't bother us, because we are a differentiated player, and frankly, we would rather be in areas where everyone else is running away versus going into areas where everyone is crowding into.
"
Person1,"I think one of the primary differences that we don't view ourselves as an international player in South Africa.
"
Person1,"We view ourselves as being a local player in South Africa, which is why the Litha business will continue to operate as an autonomous business unit.
"
Person1,"It will continue to have the Litha name.
"
Person1,"The Endo name is not well-known now, but it will be well-known in South Africa.
"
Person1,"Other than currency, which certainly has been a big headwind for the Rand over the course of the last little while, there's no reason to worry about the underlying growth dynamics in the South African market.
"
Person1,"It continues to be the most robust market in Africa, and on a local currency basis, is a market that we think, at least with the categories that we are going to focus on, is easily a high single digit growth market.
"
Person1,"Furthermore, once we have a more robust base in South Africa, being able to export products in Sub-Saharan Africa, all of those markets are double-digit growth markets.
"
Person1,"Again, that's mostly because the markets have a very small starting point.
"
Person1,"That being said, from a forward-looking basis, they can be quite attractive for us.
"
Person1,"And with respect to the Aspen portfolio and our own Litha Pharmaceutical business, we are in the middle of restructuring that entire business.
"
Person1,"And what I would say is that from a medium-term perspective, we have high single to low double-digit growth expectations for that business, and the business that we acquired from Aspen along with the pipeline, will be a very important contributor.
"
Person1,"So the product is detailed by the same field force that details XIAFLEX for Peyronie's Disease and TESTOPEL.
"
Person1,"That being said, it's not a product that's co-positioned with XIAFLEX, so it's not going to benefit from that regard.
"
Person1,"However, it will benefit from the fact that the broader reimbursement support that's in place and is being optimized with XIAFLEX is one that powers AVEED, as well.
"
Person1,"So from that standpoint, once the dust has settled on that part of the integration, it will be a net benefit for AVEED.
"
Person1,"So far, we've seen good continued upward momentum in AVEED with the permanent J code, and as we have consistently said, with these kind of buy and build products, we expect the launch phase to be a protracted one.
"
Person1,"I don't know that we can declare victory otherwise, until the end of this year.
"
Person1,"But the physician feedback on the product has been very good.
"
Person1,"People, physicians who use the product like it a lot, and the only areas for feedback, in terms of continued improvement, has been the reimbursement support, which as I said, will hopefully benefit from what we're doing for XIAFLEX as well.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Operator, I think we have time for maybe one more question.
"
Person2,"On the tax rate question, we would expect our sustained longer term effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"And then in terms of your question on M&A, I think, as we've said in the past, <UNK>, we are opportunistic in terms of new therapeutic areas, and as long as the financial criteria that we talked about are met, we could see ourselves in a range of different therapeutic areas.
"
Person1,"In think, in general, what we've told you to expect is that we are unlikely to get into a very heavily primary care-oriented therapeutic area, unlikely to be in very science-heavy areas like oncology, et cetera.
"
Person1,"But outside of that, I think we would be open to any specialty-oriented therapeutic area.
"
Person0,"Operator, I think we're all set, if you would like to wrap.
"
Person0,"Thank you, everyone, for joining the call.
"
