Person0,"Good evening, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"New products have been really well received.
"
Person0,"We have talked about it now since we have owned the business.
"
Person0,"We talked about the fact that during the hold separate there was still good investment in the pumps and still good investment in our electrostatic business and other things.
"
Person0,"So we have seen -- I think we've seen some good product rollouts on the pumps, specifically in the Asia-Pacific region and now coming into North America, certainly Europe has been there as well.
"
Person0,"It has just been some difficult times across-the-board for organic growth in North America.
"
Person0,"So I think from new product perspective, we've been good there.
"
Person0,"And it's met our expectations, I should say.
"
Person0,"Yes, we like what we are seeing out of our Medical Technology business and CIT.
"
Person0,"That started with an organic business within CIT and we added the LHI to it, that acquisition has proven to be good.
"
Person0,"We continue to have solid sales growth there, despite the fact that we hold the same type of sales and price discipline in that market as we do in CCM.
"
Person0,"So there have been some products that we have decided to exit because of their margin profile, and we have still been able to drive some nice growth there.
"
Person0,"So that's a segment we like.
"
Person0,"We are getting good traction with the investments we made in engineering resources and at the customer there to begin work on new products, and this is a long sales cycle.
"
Person0,"We know we have to go in and work on the new product development, get the certification with these OEs, but there is a lot of activity in that pipeline and we are pleased and, obviously, we continue to look for non-organic growth as well in the form of acquisition for this space.
"
Person0,"We are happy with it.
"
Person1,"Some of it relates to projects that were approved in 2016 that are carrying over to 2017.
"
Person1,"There is additional capital that relates to the SatCom launch.
"
Person1,"There is an R&D facility that we are -- I'm sorry, an R&D facility at CCM, and the restructuring in China that we took the charge for, there is capital associated with that.
"
Person1,"So those are some of the larger projects.
"
Person1,"If raws stay where they are and we get a good chunk of the price, that would reduce the numbers that <UNK> gave earlier.
"
Person1,"And I think right now we are planning for a combined pricing raw material quarterly negative impact throughout next year, similar to what we experienced in Q4.
"
Person1,"But certainly, if we are more successful on price, and/or if raw materials moderate, then there could be upside to that.
"
Person0,"For the full-year, we gave that revenue guide of mid single-digits.
"
Person0,"That assumes relatively flat pricing.
"
Person0,"There may be a little bit of year-over-year decline in Q1, we are forecasting pricing to remain sequentially flat.
"
Person0,"Again, that may be a little bit of a decline in Q1, that's our seasonally weakest quarter.
"
Person0,"But for the full-year, there is very little price that is reflected in the earnings guide that we provided.
"
Person0,"So to the extent we are able to get price in connection with the recent announcement, again that is not in the number that we have provided.
"
Person1,"I think it would be a little bit higher.
"
Person1,"I would take it to 35% to 40%.
"
Person1,"And we feel pretty good about the 40%.
"
Person1,"About -- I don't know, $0.20 or so, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"You know, you are right.
"
Person0,"First quarter of last year was the high mark on the growth and we saw things level out over that.
"
Person0,"But going into this year, and certainly what we've seen so far, I think we feel positive about Q1.
"
Person0,"It's very weather dependent.
"
Person0,"It's also early days.
"
Person0,"Not a lot of volume, so don't read anything into an early start but you know what we have been saying is, I think you can hear it on the pricing and you can hear it on the raws and that is more of the same.
"
Person0,"We think it's pretty stable and I would anticipate a good start to the year.
"
Person0,"Thanks, Latavia.
"
Person0,"This concludes our fourth-quarter 2016 earnings call.
"
Person0,"Thanks, everyone, for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you all at our next earnings call.
"
