Person0,"Not a great deal in depth, but I can give you some kind of general guidelines, because it certainly depends upon the state laws and so forth.
"
Person0,"But that mix has continued to change.
"
Person0,"The combination of -- well, basically, the larger loan portion of our portfolio, including the old sales finance portion that we are no longer -- that we're no longer offering that product, but it has risen from 39.2% as of the end of last fiscal year, to 40.5% as of the end of this fiscal year.
"
Person0,"So it's still not a dramatic change, but over time, it has -- that portion of the portfolio has grown more than the smaller loans.
"
Person0,"But as you would expect, the average loan of what we consider kind of -- they are all installment loans, but we kind of internally break them out between the differences.
"
Person0,"And it's generally geared towards what the state laws allow for loans less than a certain amount will have alternate rates and so forth.
"
Person0,"But the average loan in that portfolio, <UNK>ny, is --.
"
Person1,"In the large portfolio --.
"
Person0,"The small --
"
Person1,"It's around $960.
"
Person0,"$960.
"
Person0,"And in the larger loan portfolio, it's more like --.
"
Person1,"$3,400 -- $3,300.
"
Person0,"$3,000.
"
Person0,"So obviously, you're -- with the larger loan portfolio, you're dealing with a more qualified customer, and you are dealing with a lot lower fees and charges, but you're also dealing with a lot lower loss ratio.
"
Person0,"So, the returns are very good for both of these portfolios.
"
Person0,"But you are definitely dealing with a different customer.
"
Person0,"And it would be hard to specifically give you averages and so forth because of the changes by state and so forth.
"
Person0,"But that's -- hopefully, that gives you a general picture.
"
Person0,"It is not title pawn lending.
"
Person0,"There's no balloon payment.
"
Person0,"It's a typical installment loan.
"
Person0,"It has the same laws, fees, charges and so forth as a product without an automobile pledged as collateral.
"
Person0,"However, an automobile, that certainly improves the position.
"
Person0,"But we rarely will reprocess an automobile.
"
Person0,"I mean, we would much prefer that the customer has the ability to repay us.
"
Person0,"And we prefer not to go down that route.
"
Person0,"But potentially, yes, we could still make those loans without automobile as a collateral, but it may limit to -- in some respects -- every positive thing, whether it's collateral, whether it's a person's free cash flow, whether it's net worth or whatever, improves a person's ability to pay.
"
Person0,"So, the more the positives, the larger the loan we can make.
"
Person0,"I don't know if that answers your question directly, <UNK>, but it's --
"
Person0,"It's nominal.
"
Person0,"I mean, like -- the Company as a total probably has less than 300 or 400 repossessions in total across the entire branch network.
"
Person0,"So it's just not a very large number.
"
Person0,"If it's -- any loan in our portfolio that does not have an automobile pledged as collateral, will not fall under the proposed suggested possible rules.
"
Person0,"Because the other key ingredient is that you have to have access to the customer's checking account.
"
Person0,"And we do not do that on a single loan.
"
Person0,"I don't think insurance and other related fees grew faster than interest income.
"
Person0,"I think, if anything, it grew a little bit less, because our volume has been down throughout the entire fiscal year because of the changes that took place about a year ago.
"
Person0,"It currently has not shown up.
"
Person0,"It is not part of the net $16 million that was recognized during the current quarter.
"
Person0,"The $16 million was recognized as a gain on sale because of the nature of these previously charged-off accounts.
"
Person0,"Beginning in the month of April, and every month going forward for 18 months, we will have a similar sale that will generate approximately, plus or minus, $1 million a month.
"
Person0,"And that will be reflected as a reduction to our provision.
"
Person0,"We believe that any excess cash flow that the Company has, one of the best uses is the continued repurchase of our stock.
"
Person0,"And we intend to continually do that on an ongoing basis as long as we have the liquidity and the availability under our various -- with our various lenders to do so, and still have cushion for whatever possible needs might come around.
"
Person0,"So this is -- the goal is to continue with those repurchases in a very methodical manner, but it'd be subject to a lot of <UNK>ny's projections and assumptions and so forth going forward.
"
Person0,"So that's something we have we continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis.
"
Person0,"But I will add that, certainly, the fourth quarter, when we have such a large decrease in our outstanding balances because of our customers' excess cash flow that takes place around tax season, will always be a very good quarter for generating those excess cash flows.
"
Person0,"Well, there's two pieces.
"
Person0,"As we anticipated, when we actually stopped soliciting for those low-dollar renewals, we anticipated it would take us a year before we saw that level off.
"
Person0,"And it just so happens that in March of this year, we did experience a leveling off on that renewal volume.
"
Person0,"So that's a big plus going forward.
"
Person0,"So we don't expect to have the negative aspect of that.
"
Person0,"The second thing is, as I stated in our opening comments, that our biggest challenge does, in fact, remain our problem in attracting additional new customers.
"
Person0,"We've recognized that our primary marketing effort has been direct mail and it's not been as effective.
"
Person0,"And Janet, on the last three quarterly calls, has talked about some of the initiatives that she is doing from online applications to texting to -- we're doing some emails now.
"
Person0,"You know, so, we're doing some local marketing and calls to potential sources of applicants.
"
Person0,"So, we are doing all the things that we believe need to be done.
"
Person0,"A couple of quarters ago, it was suggested on the call that maybe we should do some kind of focus groups to determine those customers that are going elsewhere.
"
Person0,"We're going to take that individual's suggestion.
"
Person0,"And Janet has begun the process to do some of those focus groups, to find out are we missing business for reasons that we are not aware of.
"
Person0,"So it is our number one objective.
"
Person0,"It's our number one goal.
"
Person0,"And we recognize that the lifeblood of this Company is attracting new customers.
"
Person0,"So, all of our attention is focused in that direction, and we don't believe it's an insurmountable problem.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"There's not really anything else to add to what we've said in the last quarter.
"
Person1,"So we are continuing to evaluate our options.
"
Person1,"And we will likely have something in place the next couple of months.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"There doesn't appear to be any other questions.
"
Person0,"I appreciate your interest in World and your joining us today.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
"
