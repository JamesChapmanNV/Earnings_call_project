Person2,"Yes, I probably can't share that level of detail, because it's obviously hard to know, and manufacturers move slightly between month to month quarter to quarter.
"
Person2,"So again, I'll just emphasize, January's bigger, the biggest month.
"
Person2,"But other than that, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I'd just add to this.
"
Person1,"Typically, January's bigger, as <UNK> said.
"
Person1,"The other thing that we need to note is it's been an unusual stretch for some time.
"
Person1,"And so again, predicting exact ramp behavior is always a little bit tricky.
"
Person1,"As you know, years ago it was very, very systematic and today it's a little bit more one-offs.
"
Person1,"But I think, as <UNK> said, January typically is a bigger month.
"
Person1,"But I think we have to recognize that things are a little bit different and maybe not as predictable, in terms of exactly when things occur, as they might have been five years ago.
"
Person2,"Yes, and to answer your other question around generics and being able to execute on that, I think that just depends very differently on how you go to market, the size of that customer, whether it even deserves a repricing, and then how you go about that, how your relationships are with the manufacturers.
"
Person2,"So I think that can vary drastically and dramatically between different players in the marketplace.
"
Person2,"I know we feel really good about when we combined how quickly we executed.
"
Person2,"But I'm not sure I can say that anybody else would go faster or slower than us.
"
Person1,"So there are two parts to this.
"
Person1,"So let me answer the second part first.
"
Person1,"I'm not sure there's a company more focused on the community pharmacy and pharmacy industry in general.
"
Person1,"We believe that they're going to be a key player as healthcare continues to evolve.
"
Person1,"We have shortages of primary care physicians.
"
Person1,"We think pharmacists will and should play a more active role.
"
Person1,"We're doing an incredible amount of work through John Jochman's organization to make sure that we are close to them and providing all the solutions and tools that can help them compete in the market, and actually help them provide cognitive care, which we think is very important.
"
Person1,"Going back to your first point, I want to make an important note about this, because we've gotten a few questions.
"
Person1,"We are a player in oncology and as such, we've been a member of the Community Oncology Alliance.
"
Person1,"And as a member of that, we have funded research.
"
Person1,"But you specifically referred to a particular project.
"
Person1,"We did not direct the research or set the subject.
"
Person1,"So it's just important for me to comment on that.
"
Person1,"We've had questions about that paper.
"
Person1,"We didn't specifically fund a paper on this.
"
Person1,"We are basically part of an alliance and that group does research.
"
Person1,"But the summary of what I'm describing is our work around community pharmacy and around pharmacy in general is very much a part of what we do, whether it's through generic programs, abilities to help them tie to a hospital system or to a post acute facility or to set up a diabetes center.
"
Person1,"We've done a huge amount of work in providing tools to help community pharmacy compete in what is for all of us an interesting and challenging environment.
"
Person1,"You're welcome.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>, and thanks to all of you for your questions today.
"
Person1,"Our organization, just in summary, remains focused on execution, on driving our strategic priorities, on making sure that we are creating, what I would say is again, sustainable value creation for our partners and for patients and for you all.
"
Person1,"And we look forward to seeing you all in the near future, and thanks for joining us on the call today.
"
Person2,"Thanks, everyone.
"
