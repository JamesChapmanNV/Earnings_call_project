Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>
"
Person0,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"No, <UNK>, what we're trying to broadcast is the energy-- we expect we will have charge-offs to the energy that will move the allowance number, but what <UNK>-- I think did a real good job-- was giving you the provision for loan losses --
"
Person1,"<UNK>, <UNK> actually referenced this.
"
Person1,"We have $11 million specifically against the non-accruals.
"
Person1,"And call it just under 3.5% of that 3.4% against all other of the performing loans.
"
Person0,"Go ahead, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I think you will see a big make-up here in the second quarter.
"
Person0,"We saw a fair amount of business slide into the second quarter, and we are benefiting from that in the early stages of this quarter.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, I actually feel very good about the prospects for our loan growth.
"
Person0,"Again, a lot of what we have done has been related to taking market share, earning new relationships.
"
Person0,"And so as we look at our pipeline, our queue of opportunities, I think our bankers are getting more traction every quarter.
"
Person0,"I want to go back -- you asked a very good question about the resolution of these four specific energy credits.
"
Person0,"I want to remind you-- I don't really have to remind you, you all know, our special assets teams worked through roughly $2.5 billion of acquired, very troubled loans.
"
Person0,"They did so very successfully.
"
Person0,"We do not think the outcome with these four specific credits will be any different in terms of their ability to successfully resolve these situations.
"
Person0,"So I think that is important context.
"
Person0,"You bet.
"
Person0,"Amy.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Amy, and as always to those of you that had questions for us this morning, thank you for taking the time to research our business.
"
Person0,"Very thoughtful questions, and we hope we answered them adequately.
"
Person0,"And certainly invite any follow-up.
"
Person0,"Have a good day.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
