Person1,"Two data points, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"The first one is that the free cash flow was very little from working capital improvement.
"
Person1,"However, revenue increased sequentially over $60 million, yet we were able to keep, for example, receivables flat to down slightly.
"
Person1,"And therefore had no working capital burn as a result of that.
"
Person1,"So it is almost exclusively from cash earnings in the second quarter, and we think that we'll see, in the third quarter, very little from working capital improvement.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We are always going to be focused on optimizing the business.
"
Person0,"The way you do that is, in the short term, with the financial results and managing the business.
"
Person0,"I think our results, compared to last year, on much lower revenue, in a market that is worse from a competitive point of view, clearly shows that we are managing it very tightly and effectively.
"
Person0,"As we continue to do that, we need to see, hopefully, some of the deferred spending by our customers will begin to reverse over a period of time.
"
Person0,"And we will get a little bit of help on the volume.
"
Person0,"But until that happens, it is just focus on the business.
"
Person0,"But we always look at the full range of options of all our businesses.
"
Person0,"This one clearly, when you look at the capital allocation, we haven't put a lot of capital back into the business, because in the short term there is not a payback for that.
"
Person0,"But we look at all the alternatives that go with that.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"No, the second half of the year will be slightly below those numbers.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We may not have been clear in the way we described it.
"
Person0,"That 24% is looking at it versus June 30 of last year.
"
Person0,"So it is compared to where we were a year ago.
"
Person0,"But the general question, of how we are getting the through-put with the work force reduction -- it is several things.
"
Person0,"I think the team has done a really good job of not just reducing people and activity, but structurally changing significant parts of the Company, in terms of how we are organized, flattening the organization, consolidating facilities.
"
Person0,"At the same time, from an overall back-office point of view, continuing to centralize, and really taking a lot of the support functions out of the divisions, and bringing them into a common centralized corporate pool.
"
Person0,"So those are all structural enhancements that will continue whenever the volumes pick up.
"
Person0,"I think we also benefited, on those type of metrics, by Gulf of Mexico being a significant portion of the growth.
"
Person0,"It doesn't typically have the labor intensity of some of our other businesses.
"
Person0,"And I think more importantly, it highlights our ability to really respond to market activity, because we are vertically integrated.
"
Person0,"I think it is very important to highlight, on the fluids, that we have been building out this strategy for years and years.
"
Person0,"And when we do find a new product opportunity, a new customer opportunity, a new market expansion, our ability to respond to it is immediate.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I think we have got around $50 million, in round numbers, left to do as of June 30.
"
Person0,"And we will do $4 million or $5 million, the balance of the year.
"
Person0,"We are scheduled to do most of the remainder next year.
"
Person0,"There's a couple of properties we don't operate that I'm sure -- may get kicked out.
"
Person0,"And I expect the majority of the work we do will be middle to the second half of the year.
"
Person0,"We certainly don't want to be working in the first quarter, with the weather; just like everybody else defers that until they get a better weather environment.
"
Person0,"So we will be pragmatic in meeting our obligations, but also being aware of the overall market environment out there, and a continued focus on the balance sheet.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I think we are of similar opinion to the masses; that, that is not going to be a major solution for us.
"
Person0,"We're going to have to self-help, and do all the things we talked about from a cost and customer expansion, and the guys need to invest wisely into the areas where is there is continued strength.
"
Person0,"And that is what they are doing.
"
Person0,"I think Tim and his team over at the MLP, are very focused on leveraging our strengths.
"
Person0,"You heard <UNK> mention we will have an ERP implementation over the next year, to really get the Compressco and CSI groups fully effective and efficiently on a common system, across all the functions.
"
Person0,"It will be the same system as Tetra, and it allows us another incremental piece of efficiency.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, I think if you look at the business in the second quarter, and the progression we see for the balance of the year, overall, I would characterize it as just incredibly low demand.
"
Person0,"There is just a deferral of spending by our customers that is -- as you recall, it started last summer, and accelerated as the commodity prices came down, and that has continued.
"
Person0,"So there is no increase in demand taking place at all, other than the seasonality of where we are at.
"
Person0,"We had very good utilization through the second quarter, on our major diving and heavy lift assets.
"
Person0,"We expect that the majority of those assets will continue to work through the third quarter, into the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"We have a couple of gaps on our barge schedule that we are working on filling, but that is reflected in the overall guidance that we talked about.
"
Person0,"On our P&A business, we have very wisely staffed that, and scaled that, at a much lower level than we had a year ago, because of the unpredictability of the demand.
"
Person0,"And I think that is -- beyond the obvious help on the cost side, I think that has helped us stabilize the business, from a labor, workforce point of view, predictability.
"
Person0,"We feel really good about that.
"
Person0,"Our diving business has real low demand.
"
Person0,"There aren't a lot of construction projects.
"
Person0,"We had a third party that we leased through the end of last year, that we had stated we released.
"
Person0,"And we don't anticipate the need for a third-party additional asset in the near term.
"
Person0,"Hopefully, next year, we will see a couple of projects come to fruition that would give us the opportunity to match a third-party lease to that particular project.
"
Person0,"But overall, other than the typical seasonal progression, where the first quarter is the worst, second quarter is significantly better, third quarter is a little bit better, fourth quarter comes down again.
"
Person0,"It is a tough business.
"
Person0,"And to get to breakeven or above in that business -- and again, realize we have virtually zero internal work for Maritech embedded in that business, so it is all third party, in an incredibly tough market -- is a real credit to that leadership team.
"
Person0,"It is not an easy job, and the guys have done a phenomenal job managing an incredibly difficult situation.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"Thank you for all the questions.
"
Person0,"And again, thank you to our entire team at Tetra.
"
Person0,"Everybody in the company, around the world, did a phenomenal job in a very tough market.
"
Person0,"We are all proud of the group.
"
Person0,"And we look forward to meeting our guidance for the third quarter, and talking about it in early November.
"
Person0,"So thanks.
"
