Person1,"Certainly, as we talked before, <UNK>, we have a major product cost initiative going on at our Premium segment that is part of the $235 million in deal synergies and cost savings.
"
Person1,"Again, that is $25 million in FY17 and $25 million in FY18 that is driven by product cost product reductions.
"
Person1,"I think other than that, I would probably throw it over to <UNK> to talk about some of the things that they are working on from a platforming standpoint.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, I'll start off.
"
Person0,"The second half of the month was Presidents Weekend we were promotional during Presidents Weekend, as we planned to be.
"
Person0,"But we were at similar levels (technical difficulty) so we feel that the second half of the month was a pretty good harbinger, hopefully, of what this spring will be, but it has been very choppy.
"
Person0,"So we feel pretty good, but until we start hitting the big numbers as we get closer to Easter, we are not really going to know for sure.
"
Person0,"Online versus our brick-and-mortar is a little more challenging to parse out, just because one is a variable-cost model and one is a fixed-cost model.
"
Person0,"On an incremental basis, clearly we'd love to have that incremental dollar through our brick-and-mortar channel.
"
Person0,"On the other hand, on a variable-cost basis, because of our low cost of operating, with our fulfillment center, et cetera, it's a very acceptable margin.
"
Person0,"It's just the economics of the two are a little different.
"
Person0,"Yes, we do.
"
Person0,"But I'm going to let <UNK> give a little bit more color on our ship-from-store capabilities.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I think the -- <UNK>, why don't you go first.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, the $150 million did not have anything related to store rationalization.
"
Person1,"As you heard <UNK> earlier, I think we feel that there is a nice upside with this and I think we will be prepared to talk about it next quarter.
"
Person0,"It's a good question.
"
Person0,"We don't think we are losing share, but I do think that mall traffic in general, is down, if you look at the shopper track numbers.
"
Person0,"There's certainly more competition out there.
"
Person0,"You heard about some of the initiatives at JCPenney and Kohl's.
"
Person0,"You've probably heard about some of the online retailers that are focused on large size.
"
Person0,"But I think with that we are in a good position for two reasons.
"
Person0,"One, our Cacique business is a big strength in the large-size intimate industry.
"
Person0,"We are really the fashion leader and we have got the strongest brand position there.
"
Person0,"And that is about a third of our business, so it's a big driver of both traffic to the stores, as well as online.
"
Person0,"Secondarily, we think that our merchandise continues to improve.
"
Person0,"We have brought in a new merchant and we will see a little bit of her impact later this spring.
"
Person0,"And certainly she'll own fall.
"
Person0,"So we're really excited about the direction she is taking the business, as well as a new designer that will be coming on board imminently.
"
Person0,"So yes, it is very competitive out there and we like our positioning.
"
Person0,"And yes, we have to work harder to earn the traffic and earn the comp sales.
"
Person0,"But we have got a lot of initiatives underway and we're very bullish on the future of that brand.
"
Person0,"Thanks, everyone.
