Person1,"So we will see an improvement in the next couple of quarters, which will get us into that range of 10.5% to 11.5%.
"
Person1,"I can't give you specifics by quarter.
"
Person1,"But the first-quarter was very weak, so we are starting to see this quarter improve, and then we will see the next couple of quarters.
"
Person1,"We are seeing most of the improvement, really, in North America.
"
Person0,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"How are you.
"
Person0,"Both of those opportunities -- I would say the upgrade to WMATA is worth tens of millions of dollars.
"
Person0,"I think the opportunity in Sydney could be much greater than that.
"
Person1,"Sydney will likely -- it will be over the term of the contract, so we are talking that could be 8 to 10 years on the initial term.
"
Person1,"So -- this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Pretty much following what we said on the call back in January, they -- as far as sales go, it's very backend-loaded to Q4, more on the GATR side because it's a product shipment business.
"
Person1,"The TeraLogics business is very consistent quarter-to-quarter.
"
Person1,"So, I would say GATR is a little bit backend-loaded in Q4.
"
Person1,"But they are performing, margin and sales-wise, very close to what we thought they would do.
"
Person0,"Hi, this is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"How are you.
"
Person0,"We are very pleased reaching the first hurdle in early April.
"
Person0,"The next milestone is, after our fiscal year closes in the beginning of October, we will roll out a lot more functionality of SAP across all of our Defense businesses in the US.
"
Person0,"It is then followed by CTS and additional units internationally in the next fiscal year.
"
Person0,"So, we are on track for all the milestones.
"
Person0,"And I would expect to see efficiencies improvement, particularly in SG&A and supply chain spending, starting to kick in at the end of next fiscal year.
"
Person1,"Yes, and especially in Defense Systems.
"
Person1,"So, you're really -- like last year, because we are going to ship a lot of product systems, so Q4, revenue-wise, in Defense Systems, will -- they will -- be have a peak in sales and earnings in the Q4.
"
Person1,"If you look to last year, I think we made virtually most, if not all, the profits in Defense Systems in Q4.
"
Person0,"That's correct.
"
Person0,"It's just different shipments in comparison to last year.
"
Person0,"You know, we haven't given any guidance on that, so I am going to defer on the question, because we didn't provide any guidance on that.
"
Person0,"But it will be something less -- a lot less than last year because of the acquisitions and the ERP spend, to give you a little bit of color.
"
Person0,"Yes, we didn't have the specifics, but we just gave -- the currency that is causing everything is the pound.
"
Person0,"The -- when we gave our initial guidance, we gave what was the assumed rates for the year.
"
Person0,"So, the Australian and the New Zealand are relatively flat or a little bit up from where we were, but it's the pound that is probably down about 10% for the year.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person1,"That is correct.
"
Person0,"So we expect the -- this is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We expect the trial to go [N] number of months, and we expect a follow-on to happen towards the end of the calendar year.
"
Person0,"We are very hopeful that the design and build portion will have an improvement over the past and will have margin expansion there in Australia.
"
Person1,"So, organically, there's three large bids.
"
Person1,"I think we only really need to win one or two of those to really kickstart the growth.
"
Person1,"So, New York on the MTA bit, we have a KC-46 bid.
"
Person1,"As <UNK> mentioned, there is a bunch of large services contracts and Defense Services.
"
Person1,"And then Transportation has got Melbourne sitting out there as well.
"
Person1,"So it doesn't take winning all those.
"
Person1,"It is a combination of a couple of those.
"
Person0,"And our growth historic for many, many years has been a combination of organic as well as growth by acquisition, and we intend to follow that path.
"
Person0,"Yes, this is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"As I mentioned earlier, there are a number of government services or -- ground services training opportunities that are matched to our skill set.
"
Person0,"And there is a number of them, so if we win at the same rate that we have been winning, there will be growth.
"
Person0,"The portfolio reshaping of these larger companies of their services business may make sense for them.
"
Person0,"I think the environment continues to be competitive.
"
Person0,"But I am heartened by the fact that these opportunities I spoke of are not LPTA.
"
Person0,"They are best-value opportunities.
"
Person1,"And you know, the margin profile isn't as attractive as the systems business, but the incremental returns on capital are still very high in services.
"
Person1,"So, we are able to grow the business and the business is throwing off free cash flows.
"
Person1,"So the incremental returns are decent.
"
Person0,"In addition to the asset velocity, we also gained customer intimacy.
"
Person0,"A lot of the services contracts are in training.
"
Person0,"We obviously are in the training systems business, and that flow of information and experimentation is very helpful to our systems business.
"
Person0,"I think if you look at other companies, there was not as close a synergy between their services business and their rest of their business.
"
Person0,"And in our case, there is.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"So, all of the contracts -- Chicago, Vancouver, Sydney -- are profitable now, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"And we are getting some monies as we go, kind of an incremental.
"
Person0,"On the LCS contract, we are in the middle of negotiating with the customer.
"
Person0,"And, as a matter fact, we got some word recently that they are keen on resolving the issues.
"
Person0,"So, if we remain savvy, we will be able to get it done this fiscal year.
"
Person0,"And we are working towards that.
"
Person0,"Thanks for joining us on the call today.
"
Person0,"We are excited about our future and thank you very much for your interest and support in our great Company, as we work hard to create greater value.
