Person1,"We are still working on it on the inside.
"
Person1,"Old Navy has something that they will be testing.
"
Person1,"I'm not quite sure of the timing yet, but certainly within the course of this calendar year.
"
Person1,"And then I am focused on our international expansion, as well, and in particular for both Old Navy and Gap.
"
Person1,"The store size is a big opportunity for us in terms of opening up smaller, more productive real estate spaces where we otherwise wouldn't actually necessarily be able to open a store.
"
Person1,"So it is -- I'm not ready to make a pronouncement on this one.
"
Person1,"But it hasn't lost any of its importance and it certainly is being backed across the Company with a high degree of urgency.
"
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person2,"So the inventory increase, <UNK>, is really mostly due to the [intransigent] issue related to the port.
"
Person2,"We told you guys we wanted to goal ourselves at the beginning of the year, excluding the port, something like slightly down to flattish.
"
Person2,"And I would say we are pretty much there excluding this port issue that puts us up four.
"
Person2,"And then you see that we try and get back with the guidance in Q2 of getting back to tighter inventories, slightly up.
"
Person2,"And the reason we are giving ourselves a little bit of wiggle room is with those late inventories coming in, we don't want to do anything unnatural if goods aren't really liable to just force the sell-through to get to an EOQ.
"
Person2,"But it is still fairly tight when you think about it to be slightly up when last year we are lapping only an up two.
"
Person2,"So overall, I would say we are comfortable with our inventory levels and will continue to manage them quite tightly.
"
Person2,"And your second question was --
"
Person2,"Oh right.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"So that opportunity really begins with summer flows because we told you we bought our -- when we bought our spring flows, cotton really wasn't down yet.
"
Person2,"And so, yes, we hope to capture -- and we feel confident that in the second half we should get some tailwind.
"
Person2,"The magnitude of that we have also talked about isn't -- it's a low single-digit, certainly.
"
Person2,"Because the simple math that we try to help you all with to be illustrative is that if cotton prices were down 20% when we placed those orders, broadly you would expect, with nothing else changing, you would expect AUC down about 2%.
"
Person2,"But of course there is always some mix and a little bit of reinvestment here and there.
"
Person2,"But that is sort of directionally what we are trying to capture in the back half.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I mean it's a pretty simple conversation, I would say right now, which is that we are always looking at real estate opportunities, whether it's a store that we should be in, because the center has -- is no longer relevant, whether its an opportunity to down size or reposition.
"
Person1,"And so that's part of the normal ongoing part of how we (inaudible - background noise).
"
Person1,"And that's really the work that the team is doing all the time.
"
Person1,"And it's obviously here in North America where we have the most mature business.
"
Person1,"But we're obviously doing that all around the world across all of our fleets.
"
Person1,"So not really ready to say anything more about it right now in any form other than it is part of how we view running the business in a responsible way.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I don't know if you want to add anything more to that.
"
Person2,"That's right.
"
Person2,"I mean reviews on the fleet are done on an ongoing basis.
"
Person2,"And obviously we look even more deeply when brands are underperforming.
"
Person2,"Overall, historically Banana Republic has had very high returns and they have a pretty tight fleet size.
"
Person2,"So work underway more to come, I would say.
"
Person2,"But yes, it's always on our radar and its an ongoing initiative.
"
Person0,"I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.
"
Person0,"As a reminder, the press release, which is available on www.gapinc.com, contains a full recap of our first quarter results as well as the forward-looking guidance included in our prepared remarks.
"
Person0,"As always, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for further questions.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
