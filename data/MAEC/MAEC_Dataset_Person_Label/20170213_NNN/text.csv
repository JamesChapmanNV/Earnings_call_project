Person,Sentence
Person2,"<UNK>, hey, it's <UNK>.
"
Person2,"That's an excellent question.
"
Person2,"When we develop a relationship with a retailer, what we see is that it perpetuates itself over a number of years.
"
Person2,"I looked at 2016 and of the 40 relationship retailers that we did business with, 11 of them were new, meaning that we didn't do any business with them in 2015.
"
Person2,"So that's kind of a 25% rollover there or addition, I guess, in 2016.
"
Person2,"I don't have long-term historical numbers on that, but that feels like a little more than usual.
"
Person2,"We typically add a few relationships each year and have a few drop off.
"
Person2,"I will also say that 40 -- doing business with 40 relationship retailers is the biggest year we've ever had for number of relationship retailers.
"
Person2,"And 100% of our dollars invested in the fourth quarter in 2016 were with relationship retailers.
"
Person2,"And typically that percentage is more in the two-thirds of dollars invested number.
"
Person2,"Our leasing team is working on those right now.
"
Person2,"We have 31 SunTrust leases that will not be renewed in April of 2018.
"
Person2,"So we've got a little bit more than a year before the current rent stops on those properties.
"
Person2,"And the rent on those properties comprises about 0.7% of our overall base rent.
"
Person2,"So again, just to keep that in perspective, it's a very nominal amount in the big picture.
"
Person2,"Our leasing team is working on the assets and we're off to a very good start.
"
Person2,"But it's too early to report any material news yet.
"
Person2,"I think also maybe just one other factor is that there's no effect on our 2017 numbers or guidance with respect to those 31 properties.
"
Person2,"I perhaps should also add that we are scheduled to sell 10 of the SunTrust properties back to SunTrust at the end of the first quarter of 2017.
"
Person2,"That transaction does look like it's on track, and that's a at a 5.65% cap rate.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, let's touch on the last point first.
"
Person2,"We are primarily focused on small box retail and have built a portfolio that we've got.
"
Person2,"But there is room in our portfolio for larger boxes, and we look at those deals all the time.
"
Person2,"<UNK> mentioned that what we focus on a great deal is market rent when we're underwriting our acquisitions, and so we would -- we will look at big box deals, and you may see us do some of those deals over time.
"
Person2,"But they will be thoroughly, selectively underwritten.
"
Person2,"Gander did -- sporting goods stores are to a large degree apparel stores, and that's been a tough line of trade for folks, and that's what was difficult for Sports Authority and it's been difficult for Gander also.
"
Person2,"This winter was not cold enough long enough to generate the customer demand that sporting goods retailers were hoping for.
"
Person2,"All of that -- and we have very little additional exposure to sporting goods.
"
Person2,"I think maybe nothing or next to nothing.
"
Person2,"But we will -- we'll continue to look at big box deals in any category, depending on the price per -- the price, the rent per square foot, and the market rent.
"
Person2,"That's what we'll use to evaluate whether it's the right risk adjusted return for us.
"
Person1,"The reality is for us, 1031 really has no impact on the acquisition front and it comes into play occasionally on the disposition front, meaning we're selling properties to a 1031 exchange buyer.
"
Person1,"That at the margin, that's the only place it might come into play, and it would not impact our desire or interest in [up REITs] or units, et cetera.
"
Person1,"I don't think it would impact us in any way there.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, especially when you think about it, we specialize in lots and lots of small transactions, $2.7 million average, to try to create an up REIT or issue op units in that small dollar size.
"
Person0,"The complexity just isn't worth it given that there's so many opportunities that we evaluate.
"
Person0,"Should we talk about this when we know what the policy is.
"
Person1,"Yes, we're speculating like everybody else.
"
Person1,"I'll be curious, again, what comes out because I don't know anyone's really thought through the first, second and third derivative impacts of some of the things they think about.
"
Person1,"You think about taking away interest deductibility -- I hope they think that through.
"
Person1,"And so that would -- that could have ramifications, forget REITs, throughout the financial system.
"
Person1,"So I'm not sure how much of this will actually come into play.
"
Person1,"At the moment, I think tenants and what we had a little bit around this issue with lease accounting change and would that impact people if they had to keep the leases on the bounce.
"
Person1,"To date, it has not changed anyone's economic behavior, some of these changes.
"
Person1,"We'll see how the tax policy plays out, but I have a feeling that sale leaseback financing will remain a viable piece of the capital stack for a good variety of retail tenants.
"
Person2,"We saw very little disruption in that market.
"
Person2,"Again our primary focus is on doing transactions with those 40 relationship retailers and growing that pipeline of business.
"
Person2,"But we didn't see deals come unwound.
"
Person2,"We didn't see folks pulling the plug on transactions.
"
Person2,"Looking forward, I think that there's -- it feels, <UNK>, like it's just going to be -- 2017's going to be a whole lot like 2016.
"
Person2,"That there's going to be good properties out there for sale with willing sellers and competition if you're a buyer.
"
Person1,"I will I say too, in one sense I like the choppiness in the capital markets, whether it's equity or the debt markets you're referring to.
"
Person1,"Because usually what happens is to the extent that carries on for a period of time, it creates a little more discipline in the marketplace for acquisitions, and that's a better environment for us versus one where capital's widely, widely available at crazy cheap prices.
"
Person1,"So we actually like it when things tighten up a bit in the capital markets that forces a little more discipline in the acquisition market.
"
Person1,"It's better for us.
"
Person1,"Yes, I haven't really priced it out in detail.
"
Person1,"I'm guessing high 5%s today.
"
Person1,"It got to the low 6%s recently.
"
Person1,"I think it might be in the high 5%, 6% range today would be my sense.
"
Person0,"Thanks very much.
"
Person0,"We appreciate your interest.
"
Person0,"We look forward to seeing some of you at the Citi show and best regards.
"
Person0,"Cheers.
