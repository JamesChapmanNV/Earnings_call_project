Person1,"Thanks for the question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We're just trying to be a little bit careful here.
"
Person1,"The majority of the loans we put into non-performing are actually still performing today.
"
Person1,"They are performing loans.
"
Person1,"But these are loans where when we look at those particular clients we think that there is a risk that they will become non-performing sometime in the next couple of years if oil stays where it is.
"
Person1,"Remember how quickly this move has been on oil.
"
Person1,"It was only 15 months ago we were at $100 a barrel.
"
Person1,"The move has been very rapid.
"
Person1,"And we're just trying to make sure that we try and stay ahead of this so that we don't end up surprising you and ourselves later.
"
Person1,"Yes, it was just a handful of credits, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I don't know if they were shared national credits.
"
Person1,"But it was a relatively small number and they were all either upstream or services.
"
Person1,"Some of it was.
"
Person1,"There was one charge-off in energy that related to one credit.
"
Person1,"That's mostly midstream and downstream.
"
Person1,"When you look at midstream and downstream, that makes up the remainder of what we call the energy book.
"
Person1,"When you think about what lower oil prices do, for midstream it's sort of a non event, and for downstream it's actually beneficial.
"
Person1,"So, for our downstream clients, the decrease in energy prices will help them.
"
Person1,"Let me answer those backwards.
"
Person1,"Investment grade versus non-investment grade, I don't have that exact number in front of me but, as you would expect, we have a relatively higher proportion than others of investment grade.
"
Person1,"So, think about the context maybe of a third to a half of our book would actually be investment grade.
"
Person1,"And, as you would also expect when you think about a conservative underwriter like SunTrust, the criticized portion would be relatively low, and for us that's on the order of 20%.
"
Person1,"The vast majority of our loans are first lien.
