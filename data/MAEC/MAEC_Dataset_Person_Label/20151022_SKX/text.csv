Person0,"Right now, we expect to sell the inventory in in-line channels.
"
Person0,"Even though it's just a timing issue.
"
Person0,"Our on-sales position to where we stand within our whole production field has not increased, certainly not domestically, over the last six months.
"
Person0,"So, it's a timing issue of getting it in early.
"
Person0,"I think we pushed some of our suppliers to get inventory in early because of our growth anticipated for 2016 and don't want to push out our production cycle.
"
Person0,"So it's stuff that's spoken for.
"
Person0,"We're trying to get in on a much quicker basis.
"
Person0,"So I don't anticipate any real downturn in that.
"
Person0,"It changes with all of them.
"
Person0,"They all have different metrics, and they all have their way to count.
"
Person0,"I will tell you, of all the people that have been through, which is certainly at a significantly higher one, there's no one upset with how they're selling or their sell-throughs or using it as a reason to change the showcasing of the brand in their stores.
"
Person0,"People are still very, very positive about the brand and about its potential for 2016.
"
Person0,"So we take them at their word, and we still see it selling through.
"
Person0,"And I think if you look at our stores, the fact that we didn't get an extra turn and there was a lot of some-off price activity in September and within the whole channels, but our stores still comped up over 10%, even domestically for the quarter.
"
Person0,"And I could tell you they were up over 10% for the month of September.
"
Person0,"Shows you the strength of the brand, and that will manifest itself even at the wholesale level as they clean out some other things as well go forward.
"
Person0,"It's hard to tell.
"
Person0,"I mean, we have some out there.
"
Person0,"We haven't booked really fully spring yet.
"
Person0,"I think that there's some to be had, but we're waiting to see what the mix looks like.
"
Person0,"I think overall on a worldwide basis, we'll get an increase because, like I said, we have some pricing power internationally where there was currency issues.
"
Person0,"That could change the outlook in some of those countries significantly.
"
Person0,"Going in reverse order, gross margin, I think, should be fairly equivalent to what it was in Q3.
"
Person0,"There may be some slight upside because retail still has a bigger percentage there.
"
Person0,"It has a strong quarter coming up, certainly on a worldwide basis.
"
Person0,"As far as backlogs are concerned, it's obviously higher in international than it is domestically.
"
Person0,"And it's higher in Europe than certainly places like South America and Canada so far -- the increases because they're coming into some price increases, and it's early in the season.
"
Person0,"But where our strength is, is significantly higher.
"
Person0,"I would also tell you that we don't really go through a backlog scenario in China since it's predominantly retail.
"
Person0,"And now that's moving into franchising model.
"
Person0,"We may move into some of that as we go forward, but that doesn't appear anywhere in here.
"
Person0,"And obviously, that would be a big driver of significant upside on the international portion of the backlogs.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"The amount of unsold we have and the commitment we're making to inventory hasn't changed over the last six months.
"
Person0,"Certainly, it's (inaudible) in the United States.
"
Person0,"There's some increases in inventory, obviously, in the additional store count and our additional store count around the world.
"
Person0,"And obviously, places like China that have gone at 175% and opening a significant amount of doors to have more standing inventory that they have to get ready for.
"
Person0,"And domestically, which is obviously our bigger user, has the same; and it's just come in somewhat early.
"
Person0,"And if he we'd have gotten an extra turn, it would have certainly looked the same as the top line.
"
Person0,"So I think it's a timing issue.
"
Person0,"And we don't see anything there right this minute that is of concern.
"
Person0,"From what I remember, it was pretty consistent across the quarter.
"
Person0,"The comps were better in July and September on a relative basis, although August is still the biggest month for us.
"
Person0,"It still came in at, I think, very high singles or very low double digits for the month; so it was fairly consistent.
"
Person0,"So far this month, we're seeing mid to high single digits.
"
Person0,"But remember, this is now the fourth year.
"
Person0,"This quarter starts the fourth year where the stores started to comp at the double-digit basis.
"
Person0,"And it's kind of early in the month, and our forecast right now is still for high singles for the quarter.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I mean, it's anecdotal at this point; but yes.
"
Person0,"My understanding is that there were no issues with our sell-throughs or our margins from all the reports I've seen and people I've spoken to.
"
Person0,"September wasn't a great month.
"
Person0,"There was no step-up, as we've seen in the last two or three quarters to that extent.
"
Person0,"Certainly not anything of the extent that moved from July to June.
"
Person0,"So if you take the two quarters together, you could sort of even out some of that the flow.
"
Person0,"And we're in pre-lines now.
"
Person0,"We have a lot of customers rotating through.
"
Person0,"We haven't seen that many.
"
Person0,"It just started the end of last week, but those we've seen through here still make the same comments.
"
Person0,"It's a timing thing, and we don't think that holds through until the first quarter.
"
Person0,"So I don't think we've made any significant adjustments.
"
Person0,"I mean, you have to understand the order of magnitude, what we have here.
"
Person0,"As we close September, as we get into the beginning of October, we had somewhere between 1.5 million pairs and 2 million pairs on the dock that were ready for shipment.
"
Person0,"Now, in some years, we'll ship 500,00; and some years, we'll ship 1.5 million.
"
Person0,"And you're saying, in the United States, that 1.5 million is every bit of $30 million-$32 million, which we get a portion of.
"
Person0,"We got a relatively small portion this time.
"
Person0,"We will ship all of those through October and early November.
"
Person0,"As a matter of fact, we've already shipped in excess of a few million pairs in the first week-and-a-half that were here.
"
Person0,"And we still have 2 million pairs on the dock.
"
Person0,"It looks like our shipping will start to pick up and hold up as we get to the end of October and early November.
"
Person0,"At least that's what it looks like now.
"
Person0,"So we really haven't changed any production cycles for the time being.
"
Person0,"Like I said, we don't have any more uncommitted inventory in production than we had six months ago.
"
Person0,"It's higher this year than last year.
"
Person0,"That's a part of the growth.
"
Person0,"But we also have somewhat more in-house because we didn't get the extra turn this year.
"
Person0,"We're getting down into real nitty gritty now, but I'll give them to you this one time so we don't have to worry about it.
"
Person0,"Domestic is about 24%; the balance is international.
"
Person0,"And now, remember that domestic has a much bigger base.
"
Person0,"So international is up -- all that I would think, international is up probably somewhere between 35% and 40% in backlog.
"
Person0,"And does not include China.
"
Person0,"Absolutely.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"It means there's significant upside.
"
Person0,"Well, if you look at the year, the year has somewhere on the street of a 15% or so growth.
"
Person0,"I think we could grow that rate and then top of that rate.
"
Person0,"So I think it can grow significantly in the first quarter, certainly over the 15% rate.
"
Person0,"But a lot of things still have to break.
"
Person0,"I mean we're too early to commit to any of that stuff.
"
Person0,"But it certainly is possible from where we stand.
"
Person0,"Well, it's difficult to paint with such a broad brush.
"
Person0,"But it depends on the time of the year as well.
"
Person0,"You wouldn't anticipate anybody going through that philosophy as you go into back-to-school.
"
Person0,"And certainly wouldn't anticipate that going into holiday season at the end.
"
Person0,"But in months like October and like May, you can't see that because you have to clear, certainly for quarter-end, and because you to clear up and get ready for holiday.
"
Person0,"And it's not a big selling season anyway.
"
Person0,"So you would switch those things around and not bring full-price and sell off.
"
Person0,"But you certainly wouldn't continue that strategy going into holiday.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"But remember, fourth quarter is not historically our strongest.
"
Person0,"But they'll open it up, and we should perform well through that and set a very good stage for going into spring.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"It includes flows as we and our customers anticipate them.
"
Person0,"You'd have to define for me what initial and fill-ins are.
"
Person0,"I mean, obviously, no one has tested it yet.
"
Person0,"There's some repeat business.
"
Person0,"There's some styles that they're trying to comp year on year.
"
Person0,"There's some new stuff they're testing moving in their flows to the best they can see.
"
Person0,"But it's just the beginning end.
"
Person0,"We're not out too far.
"
Person0,"I mean we haven't finished booking spring yet.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"It includes everything that we have out six months, which is historically our norm.
"
Person0,"For Dicks, it's not an outrageous piece.
"
Person0,"Remember, they're only testing; they're getting started.
"
Person0,"And while it's nice and we anticipate and they anticipate some great results in movement, it's not enough to move the needle.
"
Person0,"To my knowledge, no final decision has been made on the Super Bowl.
"
Person0,"The marathon is in.
"
Person0,"We will amoritize it over the life of the contract.
"
Person0,"I'm not sure what date it begins.
"
Person0,"It might just begin in spring.
"
Person0,"But that's all calculated into our marketing spend, so I don't anticipate any wild fluctuations in that.
"
Person0,"Well, right now, it's the only one we have and the only one we're talking about.
"
Person0,"There's always some conversations going on, but we're such at the early stages of Star Wars.
"
Person0,"Remember they haven't even released the new characters yet.
"
Person0,"So it's hard to tell even what it would be as we get through the end of the year into first quarter when new characters becomes available, So it seems to have a very positive vibe now.
"
Person0,"But it's very, very early in the game.
"
Person0,"It's hard to tell exactly how successful it's going to be.
"
Person0,"They're a little bit higher in domestic, simply because we haven't changed pricing there; and there's the currency differential.
"
Person0,"I think you'll see them balance and actually maybe be higher in international, certainly in our subsidiary with -- certainly not the distributors, but the subsidiaries, as this pricing goes through first quarter.
"
Person0,"The dollar amounts were pretty equal through August and September.
"
Person0,"Historically, September is the bigger booking month for us than August.
"
Person0,"But August came in as strong, so obviously a higher percentage increase in August.
"
Person0,"I think it meant that people are coming in earlier and getting their orders done earlier, both internationally and domestic.
"
Person0,"It turned out to be our biggest booking quarter ever.
"
Person0,"And that goes back even to some pretty wild swings we had in the Shape Up days.
"
Person0,"So without a doubt, it's been our biggest booking quarter to date.
"
Person0,"That is correct.
"
Person0,"Nothing significant.
"
Person0,"With somebody our size and what happens, there's always something that could be.
"
Person0,"But there's nothing that comes to mind right this minute, certainly.
"
Person0,"Not that I know of.
"
Person0,"We could have gotten more turns.
"
Person0,"We are certainly running better.
"
Person0,"We anticipate having 50% of our additional space done and operational by then.
"
Person0,"So I would anticipate that we would have significant growth in Europe, and a bigger portion will flow through to the operating line.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"That's the way we're think about it, although there certainly can be switches and changes for domestic as we get through November/December, depending on the holiday period ends.
"
Person0,"But that's the way we have it modeled right now.
"
Person0,"I think that would be a benchmark and I would tell you that I think there are certainly possibilities of upside from there.
