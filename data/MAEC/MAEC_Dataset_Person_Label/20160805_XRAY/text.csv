Person1,"Group practices are certainly having an impact in our business.
"
Person1,"I think that's why we highlighted it as one of the six megatrends.
"
Person1,"Now you're talking to the CEO, Matt, here and I would tell you that we're never happy about doing enough in the group practice area.
"
Person1,"We do believe that they appreciate everything that DENTSPLY SIRONA has to bring to the group practice to their individual operatories.
"
Person1,"I think our 360 program has been extraordinary.
"
Person1,"The ability to educate and train is something that we've differentiated ourselves.
"
Person1,"We've got world-class brands and we're able to help them with the procedures.
"
Person1,"Certainly I would see more and more that group practices appreciate the impact that digital dentistry and single visit dentistry has on their practice.
"
Person1,"It's our belief you are going to see more of that in the quarters and years to come.
"
Person3,"Matt, it's <UNK>.
"
Person3,"I might also add that as the synergy teams come together focusing on the revenue synergy opportunities, one of the areas that they are particularly focused on and excited about with a tremendous amount of energy is, in fact, DSOs and group practices.
"
Person3,"They see the unique opportunity of the combination here driving unique value to this customer group.
"
Person3,"And, again, it's exciting to see their excitement.
"
Person3,"So I think you will hear more and more from us in this area as we move forward.
"
Person1,"And I think, just to add to that, this is becoming more than a North America phenomenon.
"
Person1,"<UNK> is really highlighting what we're seeing around the globe.
"
Person2,"Yes, the CapEx number we would expect in the range of $110 million to $125 million for the year.
"
Person2,"And CapEx conversion as we said before should clearly be above net income.
"
Person2,"We should convert more than 100% of our net income to free cash flow.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I think Australia continues to be strong for us in the quarter.
"
Person1,"Canada is in Rest of World for us, so real positive driver.
"
Person1,"Pretty pleased to see Latin America, including Brazil, hold up and grow solidly.
"
Person1,"And then China.
"
Person1,"With all the talks about what's going on in China, I would say that we've put together very solid growth, and the reality is that 7.5% is significant.
"
Person2,"We can probably say Middle East is a bit more challenged.
"
Person2,"We can say <UNK> --
"
Person1,"I said it earlier, yes, that's right.
"
Person2,"We do see this in our business.
"
Person1,"I think on the long term, a critical market for us and we're all excited about is Japan.
"
Person1,"Japan showed some slowness in the quarter, multiple reasons for that.
"
Person1,"I think we're on track.
"
Person1,"Feel good about the team we have there and the product offering, but Japan has got to be a long-term driver for us.
"
Person1,"So we would have done better had we gotten more there.
"
Person1,"But understand what's going on there, as well.
"
Person4,"Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY SIRONA.
