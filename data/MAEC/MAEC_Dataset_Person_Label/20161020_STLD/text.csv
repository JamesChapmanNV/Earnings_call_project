Person1,"Good morning.
"
Person0,"Good try on the end there, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Those compound questions are tough to handle.
"
Person0,"The pricing environment I would say it's principally product mix, and also we have on the sheet side of the business a reasonable amount of indexed contract which lags.
"
Person0,"And so that helps support our price in a downward pricing environment.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Let's simply say that we feel that our share price is dramatically undervalued right now.
"
Person0,"I'll just leave it at that.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"For anyone on the call, again, thanks for sharing your time with us.
"
Person0,"We are fully focused on yourselves, we're fully focused on our employees, and fully focused on our customer base and other constituents.
"
Person0,"I would like to thank everyone for their support of our Company.
"
Person0,"And to the employees that may be on the line, guys and girls, absolutely phenomenal job this past quarter and for everything you do for us, you do set us you apart.
"
Person0,"We are Best-in-Class and we'll continue to be so.
"
Person0,"And just be safe in everything you do.
"
Person0,"Thanks everyone.
