Person1,"No, not a guide up.
"
Person1,"We said that, largely, all of the [$16 million] would be recovered through cost savings.
"
Person1,"Obviously, given the first quarter, you can kind of run rate these things -- full-year savings is probably closer to the number -- you know, the full [$16 million].
"
Person1,"But -- so it is a slight downward -- extremely slight, to the guidance to the point where it isn't having a significant impact.
"
Person1,"But it's not -- I would not characterize it as upside.
"
Person0,"And so I think -- off of this, I think, <UNK>, you're saying the question is -- was it in our plan.
"
Person0,"And would have been incremental, I think is a little bit -- and we were looking at that going in.
"
Person0,"And so, as <UNK> highlighted, the guidance holds, and we will recover as we go through the year.
"
Person0,"So it's --
"
Person1,"It was anticipated along with the savings at the time when we gave the original guidance.
"
Person0,"Right.
"
Person0,"I think for the most part it was across all regions.
"
Person0,"As I'm going through on the aftermarket upgrades and services, I'd look at we were doing well in Asia and the Middle East, and North America.
"
Person0,"So it was pretty much -- the upgrade market and service is doing well everywhere.
"
Person0,"That's a fair statement.
"
Person0,"We look at where we are and we're not seeing or anticipating any downward pressure from already --
"
Person1,"Any further.
"
Person0,"-- any further -- that is a good way to say it, <UNK> -- any further downward pressure from where we are.
"
Person1,"Got it.
"
Person1,"Well, depending upon what currency rates do, but we do not anticipate, and guidance doesn't really anticipate, any further heavy impacts to foreign exchange.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"I will answer the second one first.
"
Person1,"CapEx of approximately $180 million for the full year.
"
Person1,"And what I mentioned was that in the second-half, we anticipate that the run rate will begin approaching that $100 million level.
"
Person1,"Is that -- okay.
"
Person1,"And I will turn it back to <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, so on initial provisioning spares in the aerospace market, we are seeing good provisioning coming from programs already launched, programs such as 787 and the like.
"
Person0,"We also are anticipating just the beginning of some of the new narrowbodies as the fiscal year goes forward, but more of that will be in 2017.
"
Person0,"But year-over-year, we're going to be up on provisioning sales.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Usually we don't break it out -- all in all, I think we're looking at about -- I think it was about a 5% overall aftermarket increase.
"
Person0,"And that's broken up between provisioning, spare parts, and repair and overhaul services.
"
Person0,"And each are up year-over-year.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Well, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today, and thank you for your questions.
"
Person0,"And hopefully, we were able to give you some clarity on our first-quarter results.
"
Person0,"And <UNK> and I will look forward to talking with all of you in the next quarter.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
