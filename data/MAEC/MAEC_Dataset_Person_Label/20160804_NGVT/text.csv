Person1,"Thank you very much.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think that's a great question.
"
Person1,"Because we do have significant outages that are scheduled for the second half of year ,and I would say they're more to the fourth quarter than the third, though we do have outages in both.
"
Person1,"Of course in every chemical business you're going to have planned outages on an annual basis.
"
Person1,"Often times, we would plan for one to two weeks for an outage for routine maintenance.
"
Person1,"In this case, and it's particular I think to the performance materials or activated carbon side of the business.
"
Person1,"We have a couple of significant outages because we're replacing some major pieces of equipment that you might not typically replace but every 15 to 20 years.
"
Person1,"And it just so happens that those are occurring this year, in this year's second half.
"
Person1,"So as we think about the impact of outages for Ingevity overall in the second half of the year, it's probably from an earning standpoint a $10 million to $15 million impact, with the majority of that impact being in Q4.
"
Person1,"And of course that's reflected in our guidance.
"
Person2,"I would say that the pressure has begun to subside, but the pressure is still downward.
"
Person2,"I think we're going to see that continue for at least another couple of quarters.
"
Person2,"Certainly not calling a bottom for that, but certainly I guess the slope of the decline has shallowed significantly.
"
Person2,"And you can really see that if you look at the year-over-year comparisons for Q1 to Q1 of last year, and then Q2 of this year versus Q2.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I think we're seeing some benefits already in 2016.
"
Person2,"I think we'll see some modest benefits in 2017.
"
Person2,"As you know, we have a portfolio of supply agreements, and those range from annual to multi-year, and really I think for the most significant of those is going to be at least mid 2017 to mid 2018, before we're really in a position to reset those contracts.
"
Person2,"And of course what happens at that point is going to depend on market conditions, supply/demand dynamics at the time that we're renegotiating those.
"
Person2,"In the meantime we're trying to position ourselves strategically, both from an inventory standpoint and a contractual standpoint, to put ourselves in the best position possible to capture savings.
"
Person2,"I think the third quarter will be very similar to the second quarter in pavement technologies applications.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"With that, I just wanted to thank all of you for participating in this morning's call.
"
Person1,"We certainly appreciate your interest in Ingevity.
"
Person1,"We do hope you share our enthusiasm for the business, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter.
"
Person1,"Have a great day.
"
