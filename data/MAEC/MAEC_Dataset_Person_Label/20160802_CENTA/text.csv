Person1,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Difficult to answer that completely, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"I would say this, we saw some rebound in our business in June and the early part of July remained very strong as well.
"
Person3,"Now if you missed some of the spring planting season, you may not get that back until the fall, or it may be next spring before you see it again.
"
Person3,"I don't think that -- we may not capture that in this current fiscal year, let's put it that way.
"
Person3,"It's too hot now in many markets to plant grass seed or to apply certain applications to your yard, so there may be some lost sales as a result of that.
"
Person3,"However, if there's lawn damage this summer, you could pick that up again this fall.
"
Person3,"Difficult to project.
"
Person4,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person4,"Yes, we actually have seen a little bit of a slowing per the Nielsen numbers.
"
Person4,"Now keep in mind that doesn't include Amazon; it doesn't include a lot of the club channels.
"
Person4,"But there has been a bit of a softening across -- broad base, real softening across the Pet categories.
"
Person4,"So we're sort of following that lead and tempering expectations.
"
Person4,"Great question.
"
Person4,"I think -- I don't know.
"
Person4,"Is it the consumer; is it a cyclical thing.
"
Person4,"We haven't been able to put our finger on it.
"
Person4,"Again, we're trying to read the tea leaves here, looking through the Nielsen data.
"
Person4,"But I think -- one of the things to get our arms around is you've got a lot more data to get your arms around these days.
"
Person4,"Whereas before you could get a better handle on things through Nielsen, now you've got big chunks of the business that don't really report through Nielsen.
"
Person4,"So we have to keep our eyes really all over the place with respect to clubs online; there's just a lot more going on.
"
Person1,"The other thing I would add is, if you look at the overall Nielsen line for the categories in aggregate, we're not talking a major deceleration.
"
Person1,"We're talking roughly a point or point and a half, the thing (inaudible).
"
Person1,"So it's really tough to tease out what exactly is causing that type of change.
"
Person4,"The other thing to add too is, if you recall, our Pet businesses had really been outperforming each category by a dramatic amount.
"
Person4,"So I think it would be a bit unrealistic to expect that to continue in perpetuity.
"
Person4,"So I think tempering it a little bit is prudent.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"I can answer that, all of the above.
"
Person1,"So I go back to our strategy.
"
Person1,"In some cases innovation will be a bigger driver on a business, and particularly businesses that we want to grow faster than the Company average.
"
Person1,"A lot of pet businesses, for example, fit that boat.
"
Person1,"I will tell you in terms of trying to grow more aggressively than market, you absolutely have to look at adjacencies, and we actively do that.
"
Person1,"Matter of fact I give a garden example, we've looked at hydroponics and we made a small acquisition there.
"
Person1,"So what I would say is, we are going to look at adjacencies.
"
Person1,"It is one way we're going to drive innovation and faster growth.
"
Person1,"We'll look at whether it makes more sense to develop those internally or make acquisitions if we can get them at the right price and the right timing.
"
Person4,"Sure, this is <UNK>.
"
Person4,"What you see on the marketplace right now are the repellents being the biggest beneficiaries of the Zika phenomenon.
"
Person4,"Our repellent business is on the professional side, and we rely on municipalities for business.
"
Person4,"We haven't seen really the federal funds trickle down to those municipalities and have not seen it manifest itself in orders as of yet.
"
Person4,"That said, we're certainly prepared to do our best, and we're on standby to help any city, county, or any of the abatement districts if we're called upon.
"
Person3,"And this is J.
"
Person3,"D.
"
Person3,"On the Garden side of the business, you're exactly right.
"
Person3,"So the controls business would have some products that could help in the control of mosquitoes, broad-spectrum multipurpose insecticides, but we don't compete in the area of personal repellent business.
"
Person1,"We're not going to shy away from private label.
"
Person1,"In instances where we're the low cost producer, in particular where we have excess capacity, we'll pursue private label.
"
Person1,"We particularly like private label in instances where we can work in partnership with the customers to develop a better product and some claims -- in many cases working with them on the claims on packaging, actual packaging graphics, so very much almost acting like a branded partner for our retail partners.
"
Person1,"So private label is something that we'll continue to pursue, and again we're the low cost producer and we have capacity leverage that we can use.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So the IMS acquisition, which was the rawhide business, is a little bit further along.
"
Person1,"One of the top initiatives is to -- I think we mentioned earlier in the call that we were consolidating seven facilities into two in our dog and cat toy and treat business.
"
Person1,"That -- IMS is one of those businesses that we're consolidating.
"
Person1,"So that's well under way.
"
Person1,"That will be happening during 2017.
"
Person1,"The second one, DMC, which is the bedding business is a little bit behind IMS as far as that integration process.
"
Person1,"And I think we're going to see more of that as 2017 develops, that we will begin to integrate that as well.
"
Person1,"There's also a lot of manufacturing synergies and expenses that we can take out of that business as well, so we're eagerly waiting to get into that on a more meaningful level.
"
Person1,"No, it hasn't.
"
Person1,"We like to stay in that 3 to 4 times range.
"
Person1,"And like we've said before we could live at the upper end of that range for a period of time for the right acquisitions.
"
Person1,"So all the same.
"
Person1,"I didn't mean for that to be the takeaway.
"
Person1,"The example I gave that the dog and cat business is related to what I'll call complex cost savings projects, which are fueling -- providing the funds to drive innovation.
"
Person1,"In innovation I would talk way beyond dog and cats, frankly across the entire Company.
"
Person1,"We're looking at all the businesses that we want to drive top-line growth on, and some will have more of that role than others.
"
Person1,"And across all those businesses we'll be doing exactly what I was talking about in terms of taking a look at our pipelines, improving the depth of our consumer insights, and investing in people and capabilities to drive even stronger innovation.
"
Person1,"It is.
"
Person1,"Yes, that was -- within our pro business that was the star of the group and has been the last few quarters.
"
Person1,"About a year ago we had added some sales folks to that team and it's done quite well.
"
Person1,"We couldn't be happier with the results.
"
Person1,"There's plenty of opportunity there.
"
Person1,"As far as penetration, we don't give that sort of guidance in a business that size, but we certainly are not opposed to hiring more sales folks and putting a little more resource behind it since what we're doing right now is working quite well.
"
Person1,"Yes, we've picked up a large food and treat manufacturer and we continue to roll out the distribution there.
"
Person1,"We've also won some business at some large retailers.
"
Person1,"Again that -- we initially start that in a given territory, and then that starts to roll out across all of our territories.
"
Person1,"So we're starting to see that really take hold and that's really what's driving a lot of the growth.
"
Person1,"Great, everybody, thank you for spending the time with us.
"
Person1,"We had a terrific quarter.
"
Person1,"We feel good about our progress and our future and appreciate you spending the time with us today, so thanks.
"
