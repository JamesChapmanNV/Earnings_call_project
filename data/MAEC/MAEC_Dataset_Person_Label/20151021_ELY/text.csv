Person0,"<UNK>, this is -- looking forward is highly speculative.
"
Person0,"Take it with a grain of salt any comments on there.
"
Person0,"There certainly has been a less promotional environment this year.
"
Person0,"There's been less inventory in the field.
"
Person0,"If you look at all of the metrics you can see that the field inventories in sticks particular are down year over year and down in a meaningful manner.
"
Person0,"That same is occurring on an international basis.
"
Person0,"Launch cycles in general have lengthened, or product life cycles.
"
Person0,"Certainly here at Callaway we've made a very conscious and strategic decision to lengthen many of our product life cycles.
"
Person0,"We feel good about that.
"
Person0,"It has led to improved market conditions in most of the markets across the globe, but particularly here in the US.
"
Person0,"Right now I feel good about it, that there's been a stability restored to the markets that is sustainable.
"
Person0,"But that's very speculative.
"
Person0,"Now it does feel sustainable and we are enjoying very stable improved trading conditions.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I think you have to be a little bit careful in looking at revenue as it compares to our production volume and the type of absorption we get.
"
Person1,"I think that we will try to produce in a more stable, constant way over the course of the year, so I wouldn't necessarily try to equate, if I understand your question properly, an expected fixed cost absorption or a variable contribution on higher margin from quarter to quarter.
"
Person1,"What I can tell you is that there's been tremendous operational improvements in the golf ball business and the margins have improved greatly year over year.
"
Person1,"I wouldn't be necessarily looking for variation from quarter to quarter on changes in volume.
"
Person1,"So if you compare our current results or our current guidance to prior, just for the impact of foreign exchange, there was actually a slight negative impact to our Q3 results versus our prior guidance for foreign exchange, about $2 million to $3 million on the top line.
"
Person1,"If you look at our full-year guidance right now and the impact of that FX on that, there is actually slight positive impact of about $3 million.
"
Person1,"I would say that's primarily due to the strengthening yen.
"
Person1,"In the grander scheme of things in the larger context of our $800 million-plus of revenue, it sort of noise.
"
Person0,"Hey, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, we are.
"
Person0,"In a local currency basis, because of the foreign exchange movements, we've also had to increase pricing in the international markets.
"
Person0,"You are seeing both the average transacted price points move up and the price points on the new products as we bake more and more technology into them.
"
Person0,"That seems to be resonating with consumers.
"
Person0,"From a Callaway perspective it's been a trend that's continued for a year or two.
"
Person0,"The sell-through results have been positive.
"
Person0,"When you look at all of the international markets, we've started to adjust pricing, including in Europe.
"
Person0,"Europe had a really strong quarter but there is some pricing in the results, particularly in Q3, in the international markets.
"
Person0,"So it's definitely part of the story.
"
Person0,"Great question.
"
Person0,"I don't know.
"
Person0,"We are moving based on what we believe our product is worth and the technology we're putting in it.
"
Person0,"In the international markets we are very successfully raising the prices.
"
Person0,"But I think there is a trend in the market as well.
"
Person0,"We are a leader, though, in so many product categories now and so many markets that I'm sure we are influential.
"
Person1,"And <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"The other thing that I would mention on pricing in this industry, it's not just the price that products are sold in at.
"
Person1,"Pricing in this industry is also having to be less promotional and have less discounts.
"
Person1,"I think the strength of our products and our market share and how the products has resonated with consumers has allowed us to be less promotional in terms of discounting.
"
Person1,"That's price too.
"
Person1,"Sometimes that's not as obvious as selling in at a higher price point, it's also us being less promotional and having to discount less given the success of the products.
"
Person1,"It's probably worth explaining because it's a little bit complicated.
"
Person1,"What's happening to the shares, they are being used in our EPS calculation.
"
Person1,"When we converted to $85 million of debt in Q3 that actually led to the issuance of 11.3 million additional shares.
"
Person1,"However, the weighted average shares that's used in the calculation for Q3 only went up by 5.3 million because that transaction happened somewhere after we were halfway through the quarter.
"
Person1,"When you look at it on a full-year basis, and <UNK> mentioned that we've actually issued a notice of redemption for the remaining principal balance.
"
Person1,"When that happens and that is redeemed, which we anticipate it would be, there'll be another 3.7 million shares.
"
Person1,"You will get the full 15 million shares now added to our basis.
"
Person1,"However, that would be averaged over 12 months for a full-year EPS calculation.
"
Person1,"So on a weighted-average basis that adds less total shares to the full-year weighted average over the full year, because it's dividing by the 12 months now.
"
Person1,"Correct, right.
"
Person1,"That's exactly right.
"
Person1,"You'll get the full effect of the 15 million shares in 2016 [earning] from day one.
"
Person0,"You got it, <UNK>, and in Q4 it's going to be closer to that more into the mid 92 million because you'll have almost all the shares in for Q4.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"I want to thank everybody for tuning in today and calling in on the call.
"
Person0,"Again, to the Callaway team, thanks for some great results.
"
Person0,"Appreciate it and let's keep it going.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
