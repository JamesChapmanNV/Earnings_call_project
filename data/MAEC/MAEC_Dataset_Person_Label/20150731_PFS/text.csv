Person1,"Pipeline yield is about 360, Dave.
"
Person1,"I guess the portfolio was around 408, if I remember correctly.
"
Person1,"360, yes.
"
Person0,"We build this -- it's not [Lego] necessarily, but I think we're spending a little time in systems to do certainly some more credit risk type events and we're certainly looking at stress testing as we move forward.
"
Person0,"I think it's something that will be building up over a period.
"
Person0,"We certainly don't see organically that $10 billion is there within two quarters or even a year, as we estimated.
"
Person0,"So absent an acquisition of a material nature, we still have a little bit of time.
"
Person0,"On the other hand, we are already building, we're also planning, we are adding maybe staff or reassigning staff to that area.
"
Person0,"So I think it's something that is going to be a little bit more -- that's why we have to look at our operations to make sure we can maybe reduce some costs or utilize technologies a little bit better on the back end.
"
Person1,"I guess that was just to note that the reason for the bump was really related to one specific credit.
"
Person1,"There was a charge of about $1.1 million, $1.2 million on a loan that has been resolved at this point.
"
Person0,"As of June 30th, Beacon has $2.4 billion under management.
"
Person0,"When we did MDE, it was an additional --
"
Person1,"It was $100 million higher.
"
Person1,"I think it was $2.5 million.
"
Person0,"$2.5 million.
"
Person0,"So not really terrible in the way of runoff.
"
Person0,"We had another small piece we did with Suffolk National Bank out on Long Island.
"
Person0,"That's been holding up very well, considering it's a new market for us.
"
Person0,"So we're pretty pleased with that.
"
Person0,"Organic growth in that space is -- it's always challenging.
"
Person0,"It is more of referral than it is just go out there and sell wealth.
"
Person0,"Getting loans is a lot different business than that.
"
Person0,"And I think we have a good strategy going forward to make sure the business and what we offer our clients has multipronged approaches to investment management, but also handholding and being able to pick up a phone and talk to somebody, versus some of the large firms.
"
Person1,"I would expect it to stabilize.
"
Person1,"It's really been a question of suitability of investment options and opportunities on the loan portfolio side instead.
"
Person1,"I think it worked out to about 90 basis points blended all in on current production.
"
Person1,"I think so.
"
Person1,"I think it could probably work down -- if credit quality continues along the same glide path, could work down to middle to high 80s ultimately, which would translate, if you excluded the acquired book, to low 90s.
"
Person1,"I can give you some pipeline information first.
"
Person1,"Pennsylvania is about $53 million of the $1.1 billion, but growing from $35 million in Q1, so we're starting to pick up a little bit more in the Pennsylvania market.
"
Person1,"That's just Pennsylvania.
"
Person1,"We also had some activity in West New Jersey as a result of the Team acquisition, which is built into there as well.
"
Person1,"The rate, as I said earlier, overall is about 360.
"
Person1,"Expected pull-through on that $1.1 billion is probably about close to 60%, so maybe roughly $580 million is what we expect to close out of that $1.1 billion.
"
Person0,"Well, certainly some smaller institutions that are suffering with deposit growth.
"
Person0,"We did see a small competitor had a 10-month CD at 1.40%.
"
Person0,"Some of our other competitors of similar size have money market rates of the same level; that is if they bring in a one-year relationship and do some other behaviors.
"
Person0,"And they're advertising them pretty heavily.
"
Person0,"So I think those are the two areas.
"
Person0,"The CD play is going on a little bit more, as people are just trying to get some deposit balances as the loan volumes have started to pick up.
"
Person0,"Again, we have been playing defense.
"
Person0,"We actually will deal with it on a one-to-one basis if there's a need to be aggressive.
"
Person0,"We've been pretty successful in the municipal market, and we also think that borrowing for four years, it makes a lot more sense than putting on a CD for 10 months at a higher rate.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much for everybody being on the call.
"
Person0,"As we move into the second half of 2015, and hopefully greater certainty regarding Fed action on interest rates, I'm confident in our ability to deliver solid financial results will continue.
"
Person0,"We appreciate the support of our stockholders and our employees' dedication to their clients, customers and their communities.
"
Person0,"And we thank you and look forward to speaking with you on our next call.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
"
