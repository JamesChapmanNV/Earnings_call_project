Person2,"Yes, that's correct.
"
Person2,"The total is $14.2 million, and it had been $13.5 million in the previous quarter.
"
Person2,"Right.
"
Person2,"Yes, as I mentioned, we're reinvesting at right now minus 33 basis points.
"
Person2,"So it's a little bit tighter in terms of duration, and the interest rate environment hasn't been that robust; so that's what's creating that.
"
Person2,"Well, we were down about 4 basis points on average compared to the second quarter.
"
Person2,"But as I mentioned in the formal remarks, the fact that we are growing loans at such a strong pace is producing higher total interest revenue.
"
Person1,"I think the lease portfolio, Aaron, we'll continue to see bleed down, probably at the same rate we've seen for a few years now.
"
Person1,"So what we're bringing on in that portfolio are good basic operating leases to commercial operations here in town.
"
Person1,"And what's coming off, obviously, as you all know, are legacy national leveraged transactions.
"
Person1,"The net effect of that is going to be that the portfolio is going to shrink.
"
Person1,"Overall, all of our asset -- all of our lending categories are performing very well right now.
"
Person1,"CRE has been the headliner for a good amount of time; it continues to be through the third quarter, and we think we still have some space left in this cycle for continued growth.
"
Person1,"Having said that, we're pretty mature in both the commercial and in particular the commercial real estate cycle.
"
Person1,"Really what you're likely to see is, as our core relationships begin to pull back in light of pricing in the marketplace, you'll likely see us doing the same.
"
Person1,"Residential mortgage has been very strong as a result of just the environment.
"
Person1,"The refinance market had been reasonable, and we've also had a good amount of condominium projects where we've been the beneficiary of good amount of market share as those projects have come to market.
"
Person1,"We're going to see a bit of a dip in that segment.
"
Person1,"We're between projects, if you will, in the cycle; so we may see some pressure on residential mortgage loan growth the next couple quarters, but we've got some projects down a year or so from now.
"
Person1,"Then finally on the other consumer side, home equity and indirect and installment and credit card, those portfolios are growing very nicely for us and really I think are a reflection of what's happening with the economy here in town.
"
Person1,"We did.
"
Person1,"Production.
"
Person1,"<UNK> has the number here.
"
Person2,"It was about 180.
"
Person2,"And that includes the servicing rights.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Well, as we mentioned, the real estate had an impact.
"
Person2,"We may have some future real estate transactions that would be one-time in nature.
"
Person2,"Other than that, the one-time items were really in the second quarter.
"
Person2,"I mentioned the 401(k) transaction.
"
Person2,"We had BOLI insurance benefits that were paid in the second quarter.
"
Person2,"So it's those types of things that are possible.
"
Person2,"The BOLI is always possible into the future.
"
Person2,"The 401(k) transaction is not going to repeat into the future.
"
Person2,"Yes, it was $1.4 million.
"
Person2,"It was actually two separate transactions and there had been a small transaction in the second quarter.
"
Person2,"So the swing or the delta was $1.4 million this quarter.
"
Person2,"That's correct.
"
Person2,"The only caveat to that is that we do have various pieces of real estate that we may sell from time to time.
"
Person2,"And so that could impact it, but you're right on the general principle.
"
Person2,"Resi mortgage is 4%, in that neighborhood.
"
Person2,"That would be typical for a 30-year mortgage.
"
Person2,"Sometimes there is blending in there of 15-year mortgages which can impact that.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"And the commercial -- let's see.
"
Person1,"The commercial mortgage space is coming on at about what's on the balance sheet right now.
"
Person1,"Well, the resi mortgage had been 4.14% in the second quarter.
"
Person1,"So you're blending in at a lower yield.
"
Person1,"Then when you take account of the fact that it's not all 30-year mortgages, -- there's some 15-year mortgages in that number -- that would be the reason.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"On average, right.
"
Person1,"But I think directionally, your sense that pricing is getting tighter is probably correct.
"
Person1,"I think versus a year ago, I would say the resi mortgage market is tighter, particularly at the jumbo end of the spectrum.
"
Person1,"Commercial real estate is pricing-wise probably tighter.
"
Person1,"C&I for obvious reasons is probably the tightest, but has been for some time now.
"
Person1,"Yes, well, I think it's tough to tell because it's a dynamic situation.
"
Person1,"But directionally I would say the market is getting more competitive, which would allude to the fact that pricing may get tighter.
"
Person1,"Well, I think what we're always looking for are reasonably granular, sticky relationship deposits.
"
Person1,"So to the extent that we can expand that book of business, we're always looking to do that.
"
Person1,"Ironically, we're probably the lowest paying deposit institution in this market which, as you know, is a pretty low cost of deposit market.
"
Person1,"And yet we've over the years had just a bounty of deposit flow in.
"
Person1,"So those will come in and those will go out; we intentionally maintain a good amount of liquidity because what we're really focused on is our relationship deposits.
"
Person1,"So if spot balances bounce from quarter to quarter, frankly that doesn't bother us as much as just understanding where we are with our relationship deposits -- which, as I look at it, core consumer and core commercial have been growing nicely for us on an average basis.
"
Person1,"The plan is to sell stock next year, and probably of the same magnitude as we've done this year and really going back one previous year.
"
Person1,"Whether it occurs exactly in the first quarter, I can't predict that at this moment.
"
Person1,"But, yes, the trend is -- the desire is to sell another slug of stock.
"
Person1,"Not much on the way of seasonality, <UNK>, because given our economy out here we don't have a lot of seasonal lending type of activity.
"
Person1,"But yes, we have had some payoffs.
"
Person1,"The C&I book is probably our least granular or most chunky portfolio for us, so we do see swings as we close on something or if something pays off.
"
Person1,"I guess what I would say is, of all of our commercial portfolios that's probably the portfolio that we're looking for just a steady -- I won't call it flatlining, but we're looking for that portfolio to be steady versus growth out into the future.
"
Person1,"Well, really for us in this marketplace there are three factors that come into play.
"
Person1,"We've got a lot of project financings in the market right now.
"
Person1,"So that in any given quarter can produce a pretty good slug of volume for us if we're the dominant mortgage provider for a particular project as it comes online.
"
Person1,"For-sale business, purchase business, has been pretty steady here in the islands.
"
Person1,"As long as sales volumes continue on the path that they have, which has been mid-single-digit growth, that should be pretty steady for us.
"
Person1,"Obviously, we'd like to do more of that business if we can.
"
Person1,"I think the swing factor is going to be refi, and refi is going to be a function of what happens rate-wise.
"
Person1,"So if we see rates drop or at least remain stable, that should be reasonable business for us.
"
Person1,"If rates move up sharply, then obviously that's going to have a negative impact on volumes.
