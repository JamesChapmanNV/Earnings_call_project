Person0,"We'd like to thank you for attending our conference on this.
"
Person0,"We are cautiously quite optimistic, and the operation of the company is going very well, and the Water-Source Heat Pump is behaving just the way we wanted it to.
"
Person0,"We're being very cautious, so we don't incur any warranty costs.
"
Person0,"We're being cautious, so we don't disappoint our customers.
"
Person0,"And when we think we've got all the software debugged -- it's mainly a software debugging, it's not relative to the [prodish] on Water-Source Heat Pump.
"
Person0,"It's all relative to the software.
"
Person0,"We will be bringing in much more in the way of orders and shipping much more product.
"
Person0,"So everything from our standpoint that we can see is optimistic.
"
Person0,"We just hope the economy goes along the way we believe it's going.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Well, we've been in the Water-Source Heat Pump business for quite some time.
"
Person0,"But it's been a very high tonnage, very specialty units.
"
Person0,"We have been able to do the very difficult jobs that large units -- that we have were capable of doing in the Water-Source Heat Pump.
"
Person0,"So those unique units we have been building for some long period of time.
"
Person0,"The units we're bringing out now, you might say that we've gone from calculus down to the first or second grade -- only first and second grades got a huge amount of the dollar volume that's in the Water-Source Heat Pumps.
"
Person0,"And so that's -- it's an easier, much easier thing to deal with, but it's much more volume intensive.
"
Person0,"And so some of those units that you are seeing there reflect that.
"
Person0,"It's not so much it's reflecting the Water-Source Heat Pumps that we're talking about building now.
"
Person0,"We've just started.
"
Person0,".
"
Person0,"Yes, see it's going to go -- probably the biggest one of those is going to be maybe $3,000 or $4,000.
"
Person0,"The biggest of some of that other stuff might have been $300,000.
"
Person0,"Thank you, again.
"
Person0,"We'll talk to you at the end of the next quarter.
"
