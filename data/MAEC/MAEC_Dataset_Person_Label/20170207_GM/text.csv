Person2,"Factored in.
"
Person2,"I mean, we factored in the expectations from -- at least ALG and other's expectations for what's happened with used car pricing.
"
Person2,"So a continued normalization of used car pricing.
"
Person2,"Obviously we factor into our pricing and cost of funds, expectations, continuously rising interest.
"
Person2,"So that's factored in.
"
Person2,"Going back to the conference, <UNK>, in January, we laid out all of the downsides and headwinds that we saw in 2017, and what we were doing to mitigate that in the context of our guidance.
"
Person2,"And the factors you mentioned were part of that -- pricing dynamic, continued investment, and new technologies, the pricing environment in the US and China, for example, raw material headwinds in 2017 versus 2016, FX from a global perspective.
"
Person2,"That dynamic is not getting any better.
"
Person2,"But when you look at the things that were under our control -- costs, our product launch cadence, which will improve mix and pricing -- we again are confident that we're going to see strong results again in 2017.
"
Person2,"Just to answer those in the order that they came in, <UNK>, as we move through the 2016 calendar year, our lease penetrations came down.
"
Person2,"You may recall, earlier in the year, first quarter, second quarter 2016, lease penetrations were up in the high-20%s, and we moved them down to where we ended.
"
Person2,"As I said, mid-20% is the appropriate level, and that's something that we would continue to manage.
"
Person2,"Relative to our lease residual exposure, or our thinking of lease residual, I've covered this before, vis-a-vis, some of the competition.
"
Person2,"We've got a different mix.
"
Person2,"Because GM Financial has been leasing vehicles and been the captive lease provider only for the last couple of years, we have a significantly different mix -- lower penetration of passenger cars, higher penetration of trucks and SUVs.
"
Person2,"And I'm not going to give you specifics on what we're assuming from used car.
"
Person2,"All I would say is, we're anticipating continued moderation and normalization of used car pricing, not inconsistent with third-party-type data that you could get out there, over the next two to three years.
"
Person2,"I would say, in total, in the range of about 7% over the next two to three years.
"
Person2,"But I'm not going to give a year-to-year specific.
"
Person2,"And one of the fundamentals relative to how we're running the business residual [modeling], we're working with GMF, our Express Drive, 100% of our vehicles being re-marketed by GMF, so that we can efficiently absorb and distribute in a way that is not detrimental to residuals, the vehicles that are coming off lease.
"
Person2,"And that's one of the reasons we've significantly reduced our daily rental sales as well.
"
Person2,"So taken in balance, I think we've got a reasonably balanced view of what's going to happen, from a residual perspective, over the next number of years.
"
Person2,"Yes, I would say the following.
"
Person2,"Over the last number of years, the pricing environment has been moderating.
"
Person2,"If you look at overall incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price, it's been inching up on a consistent basis, which is certainly not unexpected where we are in the cycle.
"
Person2,"We continue to be very disciplined.
"
Person2,"Our actual incentive spend, compared to the industry, has come down.
"
Person2,"Back three or four years ago, we were running at 110% of industry.
"
Person2,"In the 2016 calendar year, we were closer to 103% or 104%.
"
Person2,"And I think that just highlights the strength of our product lineup.
"
Person2,"I would expect to see incentive spending inch up again in 2017.
"
Person2,"We said that we expected continued pricing challenges, or competitive pricing environment, in the United States and China.
"
Person2,"Within that though, when you look at our launch cadence, let's remember, in 2016 we have the oldest compact and mid-crossover lineup in the industry, and still perform very well.
"
Person2,"That's going to be completely refreshed, which should provide an opportunity.
"
Person2,"Trucks continue to perform very well, demand is strong.
"
Person2,"We're running all of our plants on three shifts, full-on.
"
Person2,"So supply and demand in balance.
"
Person2,"Where we have challenges is, our cars, and we're aligning supply and demand on that by cutting production.
"
Person2,"So on balance, a more challenging pricing environment, but we think we're well-positioned within that, given our product launch cadence.
"
Person2,"At the last point, that is correct.
"
Person2,"To your first question, that Q4, I would say was run rate, when we have ramped up the AV engineering and cruise automation at roughly plus or minus $150 million a quarter.
"
Person2,"We weren't spending very much at all until we got into the fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"And I would expect to see a run rate similar to that in 2017, roughly $150 million a quarter.
"
Person2,"That will, we believe, be sufficient.
"
Person2,"Because we've already got the architecture, with the Bolt, to put us in a strong position from an AV standpoint.
"
Person2,"And when you look at the overall corporate sector, you've got that year-over-year roughly $450 million increase, plus there's some incremental legal expense in 2017 versus 2016 related to the ignition switch activities.
"
Person2,"And as I think about that, beyond 2017, who knows.
"
Person2,"But that should start to moderate beyond then.
"
Person2,"The EBIT bridge is on a consolidated basis, so it would exclude China.
"
Person2,"We report China equity income -- the drivers of China equity income in 2016 similar to 2015.
"
Person2,"Pretty similar.
"
Person2,"Volume is positive, mix is positive, pricing has been a 5% headwind, material cost performance has been a positive.
"
Person2,"And then as we've ramped up plants, the fixed cost has inched up net-net.
"
Person2,"In that dynamic, we've been able to maintain the equity income.
"
Person2,"But you've seen the margin compression, which we've talked about before, on a go-forward basis, due primarily to pricing, that the margins were going to compress.
"
Person2,"And we saw that play out in 2016.
"
Person2,"I think the drivers of the industry over there are very consistent.
"
Person2,"Higher volume, better mix, pricing, is going to be a headwind kind of in the same zip code, in the 5% range.
"
Person2,"Material cost efficiency will be a tailwind.
"
Person2,"And then, between their cost-down, efficiency-up and full run rate on the plants, fixed cost will be up slightly on a year-over-year basis.
"
Person2,"But generally consistent with what's been driving the business the last couple of years.
"
Person2,"Yes, for the fourth-quarter 2016 versus 2015, inventory build -- because you've got to look at the change, and the change was about 100,000 units.
"
Person2,"And when I look at the net impact of that, about $100 million.
"
Person2,"Volume was up, but mix was unfavorable, because a lot of the stock was building up stock of passenger vehicles, which we're now addressing.
"
Person2,"So that's the impact in the fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"Absolutely consistent with what we talked about back in December, we will be building inventory as we move through the first half of the year.
"
Person2,"We will be addressing the passenger car part of this with the shift reductions that we've announced.
"
Person2,"But we'll build inventory of our crossovers leading into the launch, as well as trucks.
"
Person2,"And then inventory will normalize in the second half, very similar to the dynamic we had when we transitioned from the GMT 900 to the K2.
"
Person2,"And then we would expect to end 2017 in the same zip code as 60- and roughly 70-day supply.
"
Person2,"Well, the electrification costs, depending on -- they end up in the vehicles themselves.
"
Person2,"And if it's engineering costs associated with electrification, it goes to the region, fundamentally based on engineering resources deployed.
"
Person2,"The reason that we're separating autonomous is because we would expect over time, as we continue to move that business -- along with Maven -- forward into a commercial piece of the business, that we want to make sure that there's visibility around that on the commercial side of autonomous vehicles.
"
Person2,"Because we would expect to commercialize that obviously.
"
Person2,"That would have been part of our overall engineering expense.
"
Person2,"So certainly a portion of the engineering expense, but I'm not going to break that out separately.
"
Person1,"You know, as it relates to trade overall or NAFTA, it is just really too soon to tell.
"
Person1,"But I mean I think we've got a seat at the table and are providing input, because clearly we don't want to create a situation where we impact jobs in the United States.
"
Person1,"Which will quickly happen, when you look at how integrated the supply base is, and how things go back and forth.
"
Person1,"So it's really way too soon to speculate.
"
Person1,"What we're looking for is fair, free trade, because we believe that, with every country -- because we believe then the strength of our product line will allow us to do well around the globe.
"
Person1,"So in all the conversations, we're making sure people understand possibly some not-understood aspects of the business, so a very informed decision can be made.
"
Person1,"As <UNK> said, we do support overall tax reform, but the details are key.
"
Person1,"And that's why we're having such an active voice in making sure the business is understood, the jobs we provide, et cetera.
"
Person2,"I would expect that our pricing dynamic, if you're speaking specifically to North America, will be -- year over year, on new, will be a little bit more robust than the $200 million a quarter in 2016, based on the crossover launches.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"So I just have a couple of quick closing comments here, and I want to share a couple of key takeaways.
"
Person1,"First, the Company is producing strong financial results.
"
Person1,"And I think we've given you a lot of reasons and specifics of why we plan to continue to do just that in 2017, and realize stronger financial results.
"
Person1,"We believe, overall, GM is a better, more disciplined and more focused Company.
"
Person1,"And you'll see us continue to drive that focus across all 220,000 employees around the globe.
"
Person1,"Because we believe there are more efficiencies that we can deliver, higher quality, and continue with strong products, as well as our investment in the future of mobility.
"
Person1,"All of this to drive strong shareholder value.
"
Person1,"We are taking the steps to make sure, in the very important area of the future of mobility, that we have a leadership role, and we're building on a strong foundation in many of these areas.
"
Person1,"And overall, if you step back and look at 2016 as a whole, we're demonstrating that we can do what we say what we're going to do, and continuing to build that track record of delivering on our commitments.
"
Person1,"So we look forward to a very strong 2017.
"
Person1,"And I want to thank all of you for participating on the call.
"
