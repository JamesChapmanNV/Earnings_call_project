Person1,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We ended the quarter at June 30 with about 50 field sales guys here in North America.
"
Person1,"We're targeting around the 60 range by the end of the year.
"
Person1,"But we're going to be opportunistic as the year goes on to add accordingly.
"
Person1,"On the international side, we're a mixture of direct and distributors but we've got about 25 to 30 salespeople and we'll continue to add there and be opportunistic as well, as we see fit.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"It's really more of the product mix and just fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
"
Person1,"Not seeing significant ASP resistance there, it's mostly product mix.
"
Person0,"We're not managing that from day to day.
"
Person0,"We have a certain threshold at which we want to accumulate as much as we can at this level certainly.
"
Person0,"The Board approved initially a $40 million repurchase and then second, a $10 million share repurchase.
"
Person0,"And we, at this time, will continue to purchase our shares.
"
Person0,"The later, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"As you know, we are making pretty significant investments in the business as it is.
"
Person0,"Sales force and R&D investments are at record levels.
"
Person0,"So we think what we don't need to have that much cash on the balance sheet.
"
Person0,"We think that at this price level that it's a great time to be opportunistic.
"
Person1,"I'd say yes and yes in general, <UNK>, that we're just continuing to promote and invest in the marketplace and become better known out there and more aggressively seek market share.
"
Person1,"So it's kind of across the board.
"
Person0,"We had a meeting with the FDA to lay out what we think is the path to getting broader indications.
"
Person0,"It was a constructive discussion.
"
Person0,"We've done clinical work that we're currently in the process of assembling for a 510(k) submission.
"
Person0,"I don't want to get into that level of detail, but we're encouraged by our findings and we hope to work very closely with the agency to secure broader indications.
"
Person0,"Again, I think we're very encouraged with where we believe we can go next with the truSculpt technology and also include some features and benefits that we think are going to make a big difference.
"
Person0,"And then of course, the 670 wavelength for enlighten, we think is a big deal as well.
"
Person0,"So I think those two development programs are going to have, I believe, a very positive impact on the business.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"It certainly is, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We're working on a pretty amazing technology to remove the five most popular tattoo ink colors.
"
Person0,"And as you know, different colors of light are more effective on certain tattoo inks.
"
Person0,"So by having a three wavelength solution, we're the only ones out there that can provide the patient with better outcomes with fewer treatments.
"
Person0,"So we think this is a big deal and we also think that adoption of next-generation tattoo technology is in its infancy.
"
Person1,"Well, the loss actually was a small profit once you remove the nonrecurring legal settlement and associated expenses.
"
Person1,"And then when you add back the non-cash related stock-based comp and amortization, depreciation, it gets about a $1 million profit.
"
Person1,"The legal settlement and the associated expenses are in general and administration expenses.
"
Person1,"$1.2 million.
"
Person1,"That's correct.
"
Person1,"The cash flow from operations consumed about $300,000 but when you add back to $1.2 million, you get nearly $1 million of cash accretiveness.
"
Person0,"Well, certainly with the Board's approval of the second repurchase program, there's comfort that getting our cash down to somewhere in the $20 million range is something that we think is more than sufficient.
"
Person0,"We haven't had a specific discussion to talk about at what point do we stop repurchasing stock.
"
Person0,"But we think this is a great time to be buying our shares.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I can't disclose any of the specifics of it, but it's a one-time nonrecurring legal matter that we had where there was a settlement fee as well as there were legal expenses associated that will not continue forward.
"
Person0,"Yes, <UNK>, we are bound by a confidentiality requirement here.
"
Person0,"You're welcome.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"Thank you for participating in our call today.
"
Person0,"We will be attending many investor marketing events in the third quarter and hope to see in the coming months.
"
Person0,"We look forward to updating on our business progress in the third quarter 2016 conference call in November 2016.
"
Person0,"Good afternoon and thank you for your continued interest in Cutera.
"
