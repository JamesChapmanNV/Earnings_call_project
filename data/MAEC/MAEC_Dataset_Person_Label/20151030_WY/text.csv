Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Well, I think, as <UNK> talked about in his comments on FX, a strong dollar is not a positive for [this] business.
"
Person2,"But I think as we look at the euro right now, if you look year-over-year, it has weakened considerably compared to the US dollar.
"
Person2,"So I wouldn't necessarily see that it will be significantly weaker from where it is today.
"
Person1,"Thank you for your comment regarding the improved profitability, and as I mentioned earlier, a lot of good work from our employees.
"
Person1,"With that said, in both of those businesses we've still got more work to do.
"
Person1,"In terms of growth, generally, we've said we would like to grow our Company.
"
Person1,"We'll be very disciplined about how we do.
"
Person1,"That we think our largest opportunities will be in Timberlands.
"
Person1,"But if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions in our other businesses that make sense and drive value for shareholders, that's something we would consider.
"
Person1,"But our primary focus, especially in the two businesses that you just highlighted, are continuing to improve our existing operations.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I think when we announced the share repurchase, our intent when we announced it is to fully execute it.
"
Person1,"So we'll continue to update everybody on exactly where we are on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but our intention would be to execute that -- the share repurchase over time.
"
Person1,"There's nothing to be read into that, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"In terms of our southern Timberlands, I would say our -- while there are these one-offs, our demand has been -- continued to be fairly consistent.
"
Person1,"And pricing in the third quarter was up slightly versus the second quarter.
"
Person1,"And for 2015 versus 2014, our best guess is prices will be up somewhere in the 2% to 3% range as we had indicated earlier this year.
"
Person1,"So, yes, was there some impact from those announcements.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"But was it -- did it have a significant impact on our Timberlands, either volume or price.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"There's not a lot out there right now, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I would tell you, especially for higher-quality Timberlands, when something does come -- become available, there's a lot of interest, a lot of competition, and still a lot of money out there interested in investing in this asset class.
"
Person1,"But in terms of specific opportunities other than the two that you just mentioned, not seeing a lot of activity in terms of availability.
"
Person1,"I do think the improvements that we've seen are sustainable.
"
Person1,"I do believe that we have, as I alluded to earlier, additional opportunities to improve that business going forward.
"
Person1,"So to your point, very encouraged about the progress, very encouraged about the work of our employees in that business.
"
Person1,"And there's no reason that things that we've done aren't sustainable and that there aren't additional opportunities to improve that business going forward.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Let me just close by saying thanks, everybody, for joining in this morning.
"
Person1,"And more importantly, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser and everybody have a good day.
"
