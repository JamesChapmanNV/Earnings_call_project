Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I think the biggest thing I would call out with respect to end markets is the distinction that we drew in the prepared remarks.
"
Person1,"Specifically around metalworking related, which is our core business, and you're seeing it.
"
Person1,"We talked about the fact that our core growth rates, while we're confident are above market, are actually below Company average.
"
Person1,"That's really being driven off of what we're seeing in metalworking related end markets that have been particularly hard hit.
"
Person1,"And I think the best proof point there would be the MBI, which is a sentiment index specifically geared towards metalworking shops which has gone negative now for three straight months.
"
Person1,"So that's probably the single biggest highlight that would also be influencing our results.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Good morning.
"
Person2,"Morning.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So we're actually really pleased with despite the overall top line being influenced by the macro environment and being lower than where we'd like to see it in a normalized environment, we are pleased with the cross-selling traction.
"
Person1,"So we mentioned 300 to 400 basis points in growth.
"
Person1,"I think that's important because what we've been highlighting is three big growth initiatives for CCSG.
"
Person1,"Sales force transformation and expansion being one, service improvements to the business being two, and then cross-selling being the big one.
"
Person1,"And I think we've shared that out of the gate, cross-selling has taken more time than we had initially anticipated to gain traction.
"
Person1,"That we saw the ultimate opportunity as being as large as we had sized out from the start, but it was taking a little more time.
"
Person1,"That was in fact the case.
"
Person1,"There was a significant ramp this past quarter.
"
Person1,"We're pleased with progress, and I think that was the result of a lot of actions that the team has been taking over the past number of months to increase the traction.
"
Person1,"Going forward, look, I certainly would like to think that we're building momentum here.
"
Person1,"I don't see a reason why that traction shouldn't continue.
"
Person1,"And the exciting part about that growth program is we're leveraging the entire base of the hundreds and hundreds of salespeople that we have.
"
Person1,"So there's a lot of leverage in that program.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Hey, Peyton, how are you.
"
Person1,"Sure, Peyton.
"
Person1,"I would say in general, we are seeing a continuation of what we pointed to last quarter.
"
Person1,"Which is that the larger businesses are faring better than the small guys, and we are seeing that play out in a continued differentiation in the growth rates between the large accounts and the core or the smaller accounts.
"
Person1,"So really, no surprise there, no dramatic change from the last quarter.
"
Person1,"I think what we wanted to point out though is that, that growth delta is producing at an ongoing -- in an ongoing way a gross margin headwind.
"
Person1,"That fortunately, I'm pleased with how we're making up for that headwind with some of the counter measures that we've implemented.
"
Person2,"Thank you, Peyton.
"
Person0,"Thanks again, everyone, for your continued interest.
"
Person0,"Our next earnings date is set for October 27th where we'll cover our fiscal fourth-quarter results.
"
Person0,"So we look forward to speaking to you over the coming months, and thanks again for joining us today.
