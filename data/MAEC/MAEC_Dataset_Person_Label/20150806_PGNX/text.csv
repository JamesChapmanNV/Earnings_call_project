Person0,"You mentioned EMA, <UNK>, did I hear that right.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"So, yes, we first got the drug as we acquired Molecular Insight.
"
Person0,"This trial had been underway, as you know, with Molecular Insight in the US, but they had stopped it.
"
Person0,"So our initial focus was getting this back up and running in the US.
"
Person0,"And the team did a great job with that.
"
Person0,"We have great manufacturing in place.
"
Person0,"And then, this amazing Breakthrough Therapy Designation.
"
Person0,"One of only 90, I'm told, that have been given in the US, with over 300 rejected or not approved.
"
Person0,"So I think it's a quite-significant accomplishment.
"
Person0,"How do we take it forward in Europe and in Asia.
"
Person0,"You know, I've spent time in Japan where [FEO] is an important focus in Japan.
"
Person0,"So we're looking at different alternatives.
"
Person0,"One would be to work with partners in each of those areas.
"
Person0,"The manufacturing could be done centrally, through our manufacturing site in Ontario; or we could distribute the manufacturing throughout the world, working with radiopharmaceutical manufacturers.
"
Person0,"There's so many good ones in Europe, and we see them emerging in Asia.
"
Person0,"So, that's high on our to-do list, <UNK>, but I don't have more to report than that.
"
Person0,"Yes, I don't think, <UNK>, that we have a lot of detail there.
"
Person0,"We have the statements that Valiant made in their quarterly call as they talked generally about what was happening with their drugs.
"
Person0,"And we have had discussions with the Relistor commercial team about what's happening with Relistor.
"
Person0,"I think, broadly stated, what they say to us is that they feel this quarter's sales were impacted by the inventory runoff, if you will.
"
Person0,"But despite that, we see $11.9 million in sales.
"
Person0,"So that's coming back to the run rate that we'd seen at Salix before the Valiant transaction.
"
Person0,"They feel that there will be continued impacts, although diminishing over time, basically for the remainder of this year.
"
Person0,"So I think we don't have more specific details than that, <UNK>, but we see Relistor coming out from underneath this inventory problem.
"
Person0,"I was pleased to see us get to almost $12 million in sales this quarter.
"
Person0,"And we would hope that as the inventory continues to run off with other wholesalers, that that will have a positive impact on sales.
"
Person0,"But that remains to be seen.
"
Person0,"No, we find Valiant is still thinking through what is the best approach there.
"
Person0,"I think a primary decision for them to make is, are they going to market it themselves using their existing capabilities in Europe, and perhaps enhancing them because of the potential for Relistor.
"
Person0,"Or will they want to partner with a company or companies in Europe.
"
Person0,"The Relistor submission needs to be changed from a FDA submission to a European submission.
"
Person0,"That will take a matter of months in order to have that change made.
"
Person0,"And then we would expect that to be submitted.
"
Person0,"That's our understanding.
"
Person0,"The EMA has never been concerned about the cardiovascular risk, which was a concern at the FDA and held us up for a period of time at the FDA.
"
Person0,"Now I think we're past that with the FDA.
"
Person0,"That was never a concern at the EMA level.
"
Person0,"So I think we have a good package for the EMA.
"
Person0,"But as I say, it needs to be converted into their format before it can be submitted.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone joining us today.
"
Person0,"I just wanted to make a quick announcement, to stay tuned for details on our upcoming R&D day, which is planned for October 1st in New York City.
"
Person0,"We'll be featuring thought leaders in pheochromocytoma and prostate cancer imaging, and we'll be reviewing our internal pipeline programs.
"
Person0,"We'll be providing additional details in the coming weeks, but we'll hope that you will be able to join us on October 1st in New York City.
"
Person0,"Thanks for your attention today.
