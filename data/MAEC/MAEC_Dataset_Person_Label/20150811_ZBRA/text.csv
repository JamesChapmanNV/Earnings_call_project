Person1,"So just as a reference point, so when we announced the deal, the euro was basically $1.33 and we're at [a base] roughly $1.10 up to $1.08.
"
Person2,"So as you can imagine it, has a big impact on our top line and our profitability.
"
Person2,"That said, we still expect at the end of three years, which is when we said we announced the deal, that we would get to the 18% to 20%.
"
Person2,"So my point would be is, even with that FX, we feel confident with the synergies that we're doing, with leverage on the business -- in other words, our OpEx is going to grow at a slower rate than our revenue.
"
Person2,"And that's because of a lot of integration efforts that are going on, we still feel comfortable with the 18% to 20% that we quoted, when we announced the deal, even with the FX.
"
Person1,"Yes, one point to add maybe here.
"
Person1,"Most of our competitors are dollar-denominated companies.
"
Person1,"And I would say, pretty much everybody's supply chain is predominantly dollar-denominated.
"
Person1,"So there's nobody who really gets a windfall by having a lot more costs in Europe, say.
"
Person1,"There's certainly some who have more costs in Europe.
"
Person1,"But it's on the margin, so I think that everybody is more or less in the same boat.
"
Person2,"To that point, as again we mentioned a quarter or so ago, that we increased the prices in Europe.
"
Person2,"Nice thing is our business continues to grow very strongly even with those price increases.
"
Person2,"So I think that's another positive thing for our ability to drive towards the 18% to 20% EBITDA margin.
"
Person2,"Well, I think a couple things.
"
Person2,"Number one is in the first quarter and the second quarter, we had a fair amount of costs that didn't come over.
"
Person2,"So for example, we didn't have a full complement of finance people.
"
Person2,"So when you look at our expense, even though some of these areas will increase as the year progresses a tad, relative to what the baseline was when we acquired the business, it's still below what that baseline was, that pro forma number.
"
Person2,"The other piece is our top line continues to grow at a rate much faster than our OpEx.
"
Person2,"So that by definition gives us our -- helps us drive our margin improvement.
"
Person2,"I think one thing we're trying to be clear on, is that we're driving towards net synergy improvement.
"
Person2,"So if you really look at it gross, we're doing very well in things we have identified, but we need to make sure that after the increases that we're still net $150 million of savings in year two.
"
Person2,"So that's why you're seeing not the savings in absolute dollars from the first quarter, because some of those costs really didn't come over when we acquired the business.
"
Person2,"The net number is what we expect to pull out of the business, and the target I would suggest you focus on is the EBITDA margin of 18% to 20%.
"
Person2,"So the point would be is, as we drive and are more successful in some of these synergies, we really want to invest IT in the business.
"
Person2,"So for example, we're continuing to invest in our mobile computer business to expand Android, be able to provide good Windows solutions.
"
Person2,"So it's not like everything comes down necessarily to the bottom line in terms of dollars, but when we get the EBITDA margin of 18% to 20%, that's sort of the hard target, I think as an investor you should focus on.
"
Person0,"Next question, please.
"
Person2,"Our debt to EBITDA has improved modestly from, obviously when we did the deal.
"
Person2,"Again, we paid down $130 million.
"
Person2,"We see the second half that we'll continue to generate strong cash flows to further pay down our debt.
"
Person2,"But as far as buying back shares, I think we're -- I don't want to say I think, we are absolutely committed to reducing our leverage to 3 times debt to EBITDA over the next three years.
"
Person2,"So I don't think anybody should expect us to be buying back stock for the near-term.
"
Person1,"So there's a lot of things that separate those.
"
Person1,"One of the accounts we talked about was actually a win-back, that had already installed a very prominent smartphone, and we were able to win them back to our platform.
"
Person1,"So it was not say, an incumbent Zebra account.
"
Person1,"The reason they did that, was they recognized that our total cost of ownership turns out to be much better.
"
Person1,"Our devices are much more designed for the use cases that these customers have, particularly within the Enterprise.
"
Person1,"So a greater control of the operating system environment, much greater security.
"
Person1,"You can control the applications they use.
"
Person1,"The ruggedness of the device.
"
Person1,"You have battery life that lasts the entire shift.
"
Person1,"Many of these customers are also heavy scanners -- use the device for scanning, and our scan capability is much improved, compared to any consumer device.
"
Person1,"So we have probably 10 different features or functions that really distinguish us, compared to our smartphone competitors.
"
Person3,"I would add two more.
"
Person3,"Especially as --for those customers who consider Android, remember there are two choices, Windows 10 and an Android.
"
Person3,"For those customers that consider Android, we've invested heavily in extensions to Android that ensure the security and the longevity of the platform.
"
Person3,"And those are key factors when people make decisions that they don't find to the same degree on consumer devices.
"
Person2,"We're making good -- we're making very good progress.
"
Person2,"I think one thing we recently completed was implementing CRM program that's supporting the sales group, it gives <UNK> and his team visibility to the pipeline.
"
Person2,"So as <UNK> was talking about visibility, I think one thing is we [have an] integrated tool, that was his plan.
"
Person2,"I think, generally everything is on plan.
"
Person2,"We realize that this is a big task, but we have the right people working on it.
"
Person2,"So I think we're generally on task for what we're looking to accomplish.
"
Person2,"As a percentage of growth, obviously the third quarter last year was much stronger.
"
Person2,"So as we mentioned, the second half as far as year-over-year growth is going to be a little bit more difficult than first half as we go forward.
"
Person2,"I think we give a range, because we know that some of these large deals are very binary, you either win them or you lose them.
"
Person2,"I think in the second quarter, we ended up winning a deal, which by the way the customer requested.
"
Person2,"I don't want to use the word demanded, but they strongly requested that we deliver in the quarter, which was different than our forecast.
"
Person2,"So a lot of this stuff is very lumpy.
"
Person2,"I don't know <UNK> or <UNK>, if you have any more color on the back half.
"
Person1,"I think, we believe that -- we started off with a very strong backlog.
"
Person1,"We had good backlog going into Q3, and the bookings trends certainly support the guidance we've given.
"
Person1,"But you also got to remember that Q3, particularly Q3 last year from an enterprise perspective, there was a big bounce-up from Q2.
"
Person1,"So the two comps are a little bit harder, but we still feel we have very good sales momentum.
"
Person1,"The pipeline is very good for Q3 and for Q4 and beyond.
"
Person1,"So we feel good about where we are from a revenue perspective.
"
Person1,"And if we go back to when we first combined the businesses, I think that was one of the big concerns that, could we get growth out of the business.
"
Person1,"And I feel good at what we've been able to achieve so far, and the trajectory we are on, that we are growing healthily.
"
Person1,"We are able to compete against consumer devices, and create the very solid, very profitable business.
"
Person1,"It was a little stronger than what we would normally see.
"
Person1,"But we still have to win the majority of the business in the quarter.
"
Person1,"It's not like it's orders of magnitude -- the difference.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"This concludes our call for today.
"
Person0,"Thank you for joining us.
