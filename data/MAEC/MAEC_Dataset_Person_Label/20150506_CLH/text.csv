Person0,"Good morning.
"
Person0,"Today we distributed our blended products to about 50 different distributors, and we want to continue to do that.
"
Person0,"We have good relationships.
"
Person0,"In many of those relationships, they in turn distribute directly to our customers for us.
"
Person0,"There are a number of markets where we also have customers that we have historically distributed directly to.
"
Person0,"As you look at the infrastructure that the combined Clean Harbors and Safety-Kleen now has, there are several markets where it would be more efficient, and we would be able to expand more, if we serviced a lot of our existing, let's say, Safety-Kleen core environmental customers, which total over 200,000.
"
Person0,"As we looked out over the next three years, we'd really like to get to the 80% blended level in our business.
"
Person0,"We really want to expand our blended business.
"
Person0,"It would probably be broken down into continuation of growth with our existing distribution network, as well as the expansion of our direct sale business.
"
Person0,"That's probably the number that you might want to measure us by.
"
Person0,"That 80% number is really where we'd like to get in the next three or four years.
"
Person0,"I think manufacturing was up; I think chemical was probably the one that got impacted a little bit by the strike in the port.
"
Person0,"Manufacturing -- <UNK>, did you want to touch on that.
"
Person1,"Oh, absolutely.
"
Person1,"Manufacturing is doing well.
"
Person1,"Many of our clients, whether you're talking about -- we typically don't talk about specific clients, I'm sorry.
"
Person1,"But when you talk about some of the major corporations across America, we have very good relations.
"
Person1,"To the extent, certainly, any of the expansions are going on with the lower price of natural gas and a little bit more manufacturing that we're seeing in North America, I think you'll see us grow right with that.
"
Person1,"It's not only the industrial, but it's also the waste -- the hazardous waste that they generate regularly in their business.
"
Person1,"We're excited about that, and you're seeing some evidence of that the first quarter there.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Again, thanks again for joining us today.
"
Person0,"We really appreciate your questions and comments.
"
Person0,"We're going to be participating in several conferences and events in the next month here in Boston, as well as in Las Vegas in conjunction with the Waste Expo.
"
Person0,"We hope to see many of you at those events.
"
Person0,"Thanks very much.
