Person4,"Thank you.
"
Person4,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"So the Wisconsin contribution there is just a little bit over $200 million.
"
Person4,"So the legacy piece is about, a little over $900 million.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Just really, good execution with our vendor management group just trying to drive down early termination charges on their key IT contracts, most notably their core service provider.
"
Person2,"There was some great negotiation done on behalf of the Anchor team and our team just driving those contracts lower.
"
Person3,"No.
"
Person3,"It's about $280 million at this point in time.
"
Person3,"I would say all banks are watching commercial real estate.
"
Person3,"Despite what we've said about the growth, everybody's looking at that and making sure that we don't get too heated there.
"
Person3,"We have very small energy.
"
Person3,"We've gotten a little bit of coal, we are watching that.
"
Person3,"Outside of that, everything else seems to be moving along pretty well, <UNK>
"
Person4,"No, not at all, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"I think, I get criticized when I use this analogy but I think we've earned the right to be a little more selective in our partners.
"
Person4,"We've built -- we're in the markets we want to be in.
"
Person4,"If we get a deal that makes a lot of sense with reduced earn back, great strategic opportunities, good expense saves.
"
Person4,"We clearly have to look at it, but I can tell you that we're spending a lot more energy on execution and really trying to drive higher quality earnings.
"
Person4,"September.
"
Person4,"Mid-September when we do the conversion.
"
Person4,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"There would be just a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"Depending on exactly when we execute that's really in the guidance.
"
Person2,"Then most of the benefit, though, will be in the first Q of 2017.
"
Person2,"That's absolutely correct.
"
Person2,"When opportunities present themselves.
"
Person2,"So if we get a backup in interest rates, we might look at putting some additional duration on the investment portfolio.
"
Person2,"It probably won't move the needle meaningfully but nonetheless, we're going to continue to look for opportunities, maybe swapping some stuff back to fixed rate on the loan side.
"
Person2,"Those types of actions.
"
Person2,"When opportunities present themselves, I think we'll give us a chance that insulating from some of the flatter yield curve we find ourselves in today.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I think that's a great observation.
"
Person2,"We are more asset sensitive than we've ever been as a bank.
"
Person2,"So we got more asset sensitive in the second quarter, primarily as a result of bringing on the Anchor balance sheet, even though they have commercial real estate loans, most of those loans are variable rate in nature.
"
Person2,"So we will look for ways to still remain asset sensitive and to benefit if rates ever do rise.
"
Person2,"But that is an expensive position to maintain.
"
Person2,"So to the extent that we feel comfortable adding some additional duration, we will look for those opportunities.
"
Person4,"Welcome back, Mr.
"
Person4,"<UNK>.
"
Person4,"I think the opportunities are really growth.
"
Person4,"We're just seeing -- I think we're at the beginning of seeing what this franchise can look like in terms of the growth, both on the commercial -- we don't talk about retail a lot, but as part of our United Bank & Trust partnership in Ann Arbor, we brought on an extremely talented management team, part of which -- we have a gentleman now running our retail bank that's got Huntington and Old Kent and Fifth Third background that Ray Webb is doing a great job.
"
Person4,"So I think the growth is optimistic.
"
Person4,"I wouldn't be my normal honest self if I didn't say that I think we've made some good progress on expenses.
"
Person4,"I think we still have an opportunity to do a better job on reducing cost.
"
Person4,"I will tell you were all very focused on it but at the right manner of doing that.
"
Person4,"As you think forward, I think the risks for all of us is just this yield curve and the interest rate environment.
"
Person4,"The question at the end is what keeps you awake at night.
"
Person4,"I'm not sure that stock price would be at the top of that list for me as I think through what we've done and kind of where that stock price sits.
"
Person4,"I wouldn't be doing my job if I wasn't focused on it.
"
Person4,"Yes, I think that's a great question, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"I think that's one of the things Chris is looking at.
"
Person4,"Chris is two months on the job in indirect and the balance of his capital markets -- you saw the yield increase there through some of his efforts.
"
Person4,"But we've asked Chris and Chris is going to take a real hard look at that portfolio to see if it's the best use of capital and funding.
"
Person4,"I think as you look forward to the future, we will have some more decisions to communicate there.
"
Person4,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"Glad to have you back.
"
Person4,"Welcome back.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we're always looking at opportunities to keep that tax rate in check.
"
Person2,"So obviously as we make more income that will put pressure on that rate, but I don't know if we're willing to say this point in time that rate is going to go back up from here.
"
Person2,"I think we're continuing to look for ways to moderate that rate even into 2017.
"
Person4,"As part of what Chris is focused on in the capital markets with some of his transactions in that group, we've also got some way to moderate our taxes.
"
Person4,"So, as <UNK> said, we're feeling keenly focused on it.
"
Person4,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"Great.
"
Person4,"Thank you all.
"
Person4,"Thank you for your insightful questions.
"
Person4,"Any follow-up, let <UNK> know.
"
Person4,"We look forward to talking to you again soon.
"
