Person,Sentence
Person1,"Yes a couple things - one, in department stores, what we are seeing for us is obviously a little bit different than some of our competitive set in that we're not as mature in the department store space as they are.
"
Person1,"So we are seeing continued growth and new opportunities in department store, whether it's in our core segments and categories or whether it's in some of these new brand extensions that we've been talking about.
"
Person1,"But we have seen a little bit of pressure in, you say, true like-for-like performance.
"
Person1,"So there's a little bit but we are able to more than offset that as we continue to grow and expand.
"
Person1,"And in terms of adding new distribution, obviously that's something we are continuing to look at in the specialty store.
"
Person1,"We have been adding a few new apparel and accessories stores to the mix.
"
Person1,"And I would still say we are early in that growth.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Generally, the May performance is really reflected in our guidance as we talk about second quarter and we haven't seen a material difference.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, as it related to Q1, February was probably our best month and then really, March, April and May have been much of the same for the most part.
"
Person2,"Yes, that's one of our executives - we put out an 8-K, I think just a couple of weeks ago, and it's Roddy Mann who is leading up the sales force.
"
Person2,"So he left us, actually today - or yesterday was his last day - and we've also hired Mary Beth, who will be leading the wholesale side of our business.
"
Person2,"And that we have Melissa leading the direct side and both of those individuals will be reporting to <UNK> directly.
"
Person1,"Basically, just for your knowledge too, that was something that Roddy and I had worked out that he basically spent the last year helping get our sales organization ready for this transition and we feel really good about the team we have in place.
"
Person2,"Oh gosh.
"
Person2,"In Q1 of this year, it's in the 70%s, the low 70% range, and it's really very similar to Q4.
"
Person2,"And then if you look at Q1 of last year it was probably in the 40% range.
"
Person2,"We started the year at 25%, worked our way up to 70%, it so its probably in the 40% range in Q1 of last year.
"
Person2,"That is correct.
"
Person2,"We'll still get a little bit of a benefit in our gross margin in Q2, and then post- Q2 we're really at that percentage we foresee being at for the foreseeable future, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"So not a lot of benefit going forward after Q2
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"We've just stated at this point that the total comp is what we are expecting to turn positive at some point in the back half of the year.
"
Person2,"We're obviously expecting improvement across the board as you look at our full price stores as well, but what we've stated is the total comp we expect to be positive as we exit the year.
"
Person2,"That's correct.
"
Person2,"That could be one way to get there.
"
Person2,"It was about $2.5 million.
"
Person2,"That's the amount -- it related to a pattern launch we did in May last year - I think it was Sierra that was the pattern name.
"
Person2,"We actually pulled that into Q1 of this year, and it was around $2.5 million on the specialty side of our business, which was the significant movement from Q2 to Q1 this year.
"
Person2,"You know, still feel like on the direct side of the business it's getting comps going and to be able to leverage our SG&A expenses, obviously we've been very proud of the gross margin improvement we've seen this year and last year.
"
Person2,"But really on the direct side, it's really being able to leverage the SG&A expenses by getting the sales up.
"
Person2,"On the indirect side -- probably there, I feel like we are in a good place.
"
Person2,"I don't feel like there's a huge improvement looking forward.
"
Person2,"I think we are right around 39%, 36% I think -- oh no, 39% in the quarter, and I feel like that was a pretty good percentage.
"
Person2,"And what we've stated over the long-term is we really don't see that number going up very significantly.
"
Person2,"I think there will continue to be pressure on the indirect side as we continue to expand in the department stores, just with regards to chargebacks and returns and things like that we need to manage very closely, which we are.
"
Person2,"So I feel like the opportunity to leverage from an operating income percentage perspective is on the direct side of the business.
"
Person2,"And beyond that we can leverage a little bit our corporate expenses as well, looking forward.
"
Person1,"As we continue with our business turnaround, we believe we have a clear direction and road map to assure our brand is more modern and relevant to the Daymaker.
"
Person1,"We remain energized and excited about the future of Vera Bradley and thank you for joining us today and for your interest, time and questions.
"
Person1,"And we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call on August 31.
"
