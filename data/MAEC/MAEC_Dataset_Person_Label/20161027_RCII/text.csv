Person2,"Yes, we didn't say that, <UNK>, although, we have been tracking about 20 basis points of sequential improvement every quarter since the rollout of the new sourcing initiative.
"
Person2,"So, we've been up 20 basis points in the fourth quarter; 40 in the first quarter; 60 in the second quarter, although in total we were up 120 in the second quarter, but about 60 of that was related to the sourcing event.
"
Person2,"I would have expected that we would have been, call it, 60 to 80 basis points up in the core had it not been for the clearance event.
"
Person2,"So it did have an impact on gross margins as a result.
"
Person2,"Of course now some of those items are in our portfolio, so they certainly will continue to have an impact moving forward.
"
Person2,"But we're also in a much better position in terms of percent new moving into the fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"So, items that we add to the portfolio now should have a disproportionately positive impact moving forward.
"
Person2,"I wouldn't want to suggest that what happened in Q3 will carry over and be the case again in Q4.
"
Person2,"I think we also -- we're well positioned now as a result of the higher percent new to improve upon the gross margin number that we deliver in the third quarter.
"
Person1,"We have not seen instances of retail partners wanting to do this on their own.
"
Person1,"Certainly there are other alternatives to Acceptance Now out in the marketplace -- none that serves customers to the level and degree that we do by having human beings and co-workers in stores to help overcome objections, and explain the rental transaction, and really nurture the consumer from end-to-end on the process, as well as take the burden off the retail partner by being available to explain the transaction to the consumer.
"
Person1,"So from our perspective, albeit there is heightened competition in the marketplace, we still continue to believe in our manned model as we march forward.
"
Person1,"Having said that, not seeing retail partners doing this themselves.
"
Person1,"In this instance, in the one case I referred to, that retail partner is issuing an RFP to other competitors and ourselves.
"
Person1,"And we, frankly, just chose not to participate given the irrational requirements that they were asking for us to acquiesce to.
"
Person1,"Again, as we sit here today and we're poised for growth in Acceptance Now, I am a firm proponent of the approach we're taking, and I'm excited about our national accounts approach as well as the other manned locations we've opened year-to-date.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Shelby, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.
"
Person1,"Appreciate your interest, your time, your attention, and your support.
"
Person1,"Certainly, a challenging third quarter related to our systems issues that, unfortunately, had a material impact in Q3.
"
Person1,"As I indicated in my prepared comments, I'm encouraged by current tone of business, trends we're seeing.
"
Person1,"And this important fourth quarter, in my opinion, is going to be very productive for us.
"
Person1,"So, I look forward to reporting back those results next quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
