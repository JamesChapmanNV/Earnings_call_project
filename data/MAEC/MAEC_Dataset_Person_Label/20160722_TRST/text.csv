Person0,"As the host said, I'm Rob <UNK>, President and CEO of the Bank.
"
Person0,"As usual, I'm joined by our CFO, <UNK> <UNK>, and our Chief Banking Officer <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Also in the room is Kevin Timmons, who a lot of you deal with regularly.
"
Person0,"Our plan is the same as always.
"
Person0,"I will give a brief summary, then turn it over to <UNK> <UNK> to detail the numbers.
"
Person0,"<UNK> <UNK> with the Operations, especially our loan portfolio.
"
Person0,"This will leave time for questions you may have.
"
Person0,"Our loan growth has been very good.
"
Person0,"We ended the quarter at $3.34 billion.
"
Person0,"That's up about $100 million year over year.
"
Person0,"We have seen some seasonality return to residential mortgage lending.
"
Person0,"We've built a decent backlog, which <UNK> will touch on later in the call.
"
Person0,"As our release stated, our loan growth was impacted by about $11 million of loans outstanding in our commercial loan portfolio.
"
Person0,"As we talked about before, we are seeing some very aggressive lenders in the areas we service, both REITs and standards.
"
Person0,"We're working with our existing customers and taking a cautious approach to this lending segment.
"
Person0,"Our asset quality remains strong.
"
Person0,"Nonperforming assets fell by $5.7 million year over year, resulting in a nonperforming asset ratio of 0.68%, compared to 0.81% a year ago.
"
Person0,"Nonperforming loans also showed improvement, as did early-stage delinquencies and charge-offs.
"
Person0,"We continue to grow our deposit base to $4.18 billion.
"
Person0,"We are encouraged with our core growth and our average deposits per branch continuing to grow and show improvement.
"
Person0,"We didn't open any branches this quarter.
"
Person0,"As a matter fact, we closed one of our Union Street branches earlier in the year.
"
Person0,"The building has been sold, and the closing took place in early July.
"
Person0,"Just a good opportunity for consolidation.
"
Person0,"Our return on average assets was 0.88%.
"
Person0,"Our return on average equity was 9.88%.
"
Person0,"Our margin, quarter over quarter, was down a little to 3.09%, but that's actually better than 2015.
"
Person0,"We continue to maintain a strong loan loss allowance with solid coverage ratio, which also showed continued improvement.
"
Person0,"Our efficiency ratio is 57.7%, higher than we like but better than most.
"
Person0,"Certainly the cost of compliance is a factor.
"
Person0,"Our tangible equity ratio has shown steady growth, growing this quarter to 8.9%.
"
Person0,"We are operating under a formal agreement, I think most of you know that, with the OCC.
"
Person0,"While not a lot can be discussed, we are moving forward with a lot of validations, and are optimistic we will emerge a better Company.
"
Person0,"(inaudible) did not receive enough votes to pass this year's proxy.
"
Person0,"Our Board compensation committee has taken us under review.
"
Person0,"As a matter of fact, there was a release last night about our call-back policy.
"
Person0,"Most of you know we maintain a relatively large investment portfolio with a very strong liquidity position.
"
Person0,"Banking is certainly a challenging environment.
"
Person0,"We feel our Company is well-positioned to deal with whatever is thrown at us, and we are very optimistic about the future of our Company.
"
Person0,"Now I'm going to turn it over to <UNK> to detail the numbers.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
"
Person0,"Good morning, Alex.
"
Person0,"We haven't seen a big change in that number, Alex.
"
Person0,"It's about seven and one-half years, and seven and one-half years to nine years, depending on the month.
"
Person0,"There has been some extension, but nothing that's significant and -- or really even worth mentioning at this point.
"
Person0,"So it's a $3.3 billion behemoth [de moose] -- like a dinosaur, and it takes a lot of origination to move that either way.
"
Person0,"And consumer habits -- I think we've talked about on the call before -- consumer habits certainly haven't changed, and we haven't seen people sticking with the mortgage just because of that.
"
Person0,"They still want the new bathrooms, and they get divorced, and all of those things.
"
Person0,"And you also to remember, our average loan balance is probably a little lower than our peer group, too.
"
Person0,"What happens is you get -- yes -- I don't know, do you want to answer it.
"
Person0,"What happens is, a lot of times impaired loans, you have to keep them nonperforming for a very long period of time.
"
Person0,"So if there's an opportunity -- for the life of loan.
"
Person0,"If there's an opportunity to unload them at a decent price, Alex, we take advantage of it.
"
Person0,"We are not burdened with it.
"
Person0,"We've done it several times in the past.
"
Person0,"Yes, I think we're spending more time on our deposit pricing, and looking for opportunities in our CD portfolio.
"
Person0,"And as far as the investment portfolio goes, we are trying to stay as short as we possibly can, and not getting crazy on that.
"
Person0,"If you've held the trigger for as long as we have, we certainly don't want to blow it at the last -- at the end of the -- at what appears to be the end of a cycle.
"
Person1,"Yes, when we look at it, the reality is, is the loan portfolio is still the -- and we've said it before, but it's -- the loan portfolio is still the best place to put the money.
"
Person1,"And you look at last quarter, we did deploy North of $100 million into the investment portfolio.
"
Person1,"So we're in the market, but just what Rob said, we're not looking to go too far in right now at what we probably -- which is probably [the mob].
"
Person0,"Your question about floor earlier, Alex, was perfect, because if Cushing and my father were here, they probably would have said 7%.
"
Person0,"(laughter).
"
Person0,"Shows how the world has changed.
"
Person0,"Thank you
"
Person0,"Thank you for your interest in our Company, and have a great day.
