Person,Sentence
Person0,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
"
Person0,"On today's call are <UNK> <UNK>, Chief Executive Officer; and <UNK> de <UNK>, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer.
"
Person0,"I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements.
"
Person0,"Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where we list factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
"
Person0,"All commentary on organic net revenues reflect the comparison of Legacy-Coty and the P&G Beauty Business on a combined net revenue basis at constant currency in both the current and prior year periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business.
"
Person0,"In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our earnings release.
"
Person0,"You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.
"
Person0,"I will now turn the call over to <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call.
"
Person1,"Q1 was a much better quarter.
"
Person1,"We saw strong growth in Luxury, continued positive momentum in Professional and a reduced net revenue decline in the Consumer Beauty division.
"
Person1,"We delivered significant improvement in profits, driven by better gross margin performance and strong financial discipline on the cost structure.
"
Person1,"We also continued making meaningful progress in our merger integration and I\
"
Person2,"Thank you, <UNK>, and good morning, everyone.
"
Person2,"Q1 was a much better quarter with all key metrics, revenues, growth and operating margin and operating cash flow making progress.
"
Person2,"Before further elaborating on our results, let us start with our integration plan.
"
Person2,"After an enormous amount of work by our very dedicated team, I am thrilled to announce the successful exit of the third and final stage of our Transition Service Agreement with P&G in the ALMEA regions following our exits from North America in May and Europe in July.
"
Person2,"This is an important moment for the new Coty as we now have control of our data, processes and systems.
"
Person2,"With TSA behind us, we will now work on the completion of the integration to fully leverage the simplified and optimized infrastructure, continue to stabilize the combined business and build on some of the momentum we are seeing across the portfolio.
"
Person2,"As <UNK> already mentioned, we significantly increased our efforts on the cost structure as part of our existing synergy program with many ongoing initiatives, from significantly strengthening cost control measures on expenses, consolidating commercial office facilities to gain scale and efficiency and deploying a number of global centers of excellence teams to help optimize our local operations, including the streamlining of our field sales force.
"
Person2,"Some of these initiatives, in addition to the continued execution of our growth strategies across our business lines, have already led to tangible signs of progress during the first quarter, when our overall profitability made good progress even though the bulk of our synergies from the P&G Beauty merger have yet to be achieved.
"
Person2,"Our focus now is on driving consistent profitable growth across our business while maintaining a very strong cost discipline in order to achieve our ambition of best-in-class operating margin.
"
Person2,"Indeed, it is fair to say reaching best-in-class operating margin is what is driving our business decisions.
"
Person2,"Now, onto our results.
"
Person2,"First quarter net revenues were $2.2 billion, a 107% increase versus last year, largely attributable to the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, while our organic net revenues declined 2%.
"
Person2,"Adjusted gross margin was 61.6%, representing a 280 basis point improvement year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of increase, driven by supply chain and procurement synergies as well as our acquisition strategy.
"
Person2,"A tight financial discipline allowed us to generate an adjusted operating income of $195 million, well above Coty stand-alone, with a 17% growth resulting in a 9% adjusted operating margin.
"
Person2,"The increase is even more pronounced if we take into account that the inherited business from P&G was loss-making in Q1 prior year.
"
Person2,"This improved operating profit performance is good evidence that we are taking our operating margin ambition very seriously.
"
Person2,"Interest expense of $66 million reflects higher debt balance incurred as part of the financing of the P&G Beauty, ghd and Younique transactions.
"
Person2,"Our effective tax rate of 27%, in line with expectations, result in an adjusted net income for the quarter of $76 million or an equivalent adjusted earnings per share of $0.10, ahead of expectations.
"
Person2,"We continue to achieve strong working capital improvement to free up cash to deleverage the business.
"
Person2,"Our averaging -- our average working capital was negative for Q1 and we believe there are still some more working capital improvement to come.
"
Person2,"During the quarter, we also continued to return cash to shareholders, paying $94 million in dividends.
"
Person2,"I'd like to add a few additional details to our performance in our 3 divisions.
"
Person2,"First, in Luxury, our gross margin in the first quarter has improved thanks to accretive innovation and good productivity improvement in the supply chain.
"
Person2,"This, combined with a strong emphasis on our cost structure, delivered an adjusted operating income of $90 million, roughly in line with the prior year, while absorbing the losses of the inherited P&G business.
"
Person2,"We are positive about the momentum as our investment behind innovation and new marketing campaigns began to bear fruit this year.
"
Person2,"Our Professional division revenues grew moderately with the gross margin slightly improving and an adjusted operating income of $17 million.
"
Person2,"The level of profitability has been impacted by the ghd seasonality, Q1 being the lowest quarter of the year from a revenue standpoint.
"
Person2,"Despite the revenue challenges in Consumer Beauty, adjusted operating income increased 54% to $88 million, resulting in a 9% adjusted operating income margin due to structural improvement in our gross margin as well as the continued success of Younique, which maintained double-digit top line growth while continuing to be accretive to overall margins.
"
Person2,"Finally, as said before, we continue to focus on pursuing rationalization, whether via divestiture or discontinuation, of 6% to 8% of the combined portfolio, which we expect to announce by the close of fiscal 2018.
"
Person2,"This initiative should help to improve our revenue growth trajectory over time.
"
Person2,"To conclude, this quarter has put an important milestone behind us with the successful TSA exit.
"
Person2,"We are now focusing on building our new foundation to match our ambition of being a serious challenger and delivering best-in-class operating margin.
"
Person2,"As <UNK> said, we aim to deliver improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year as well as a healthy operating margin improvement over the balance of the year with a more pronounced positive impact in Q4 thanks to synergies delivery and favorable base comparison.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"We will now open the call for questions.
"
Person1,"Thanks for the question, Joe.
"
Person1,"Let me start by reiterating what <UNK> said, which is that our long-term focus is on achieving best-in-class sustainable operating margins.
"
Person1,"And this is in line with our investment thesis that we referred in our roadshow at the time of the merger.
"
Person1,"And this is how we are making business decisions.
"
Person1,"Now, it's fair to say, as you know, that we have inherited a business which was smaller in revenues, but not in SG&A and, therefore, smaller in operating margin than our expectation at the time of the roadshow.
"
Person1,"And because of this, when you combine also with the business challenges that we have faced last year and our better visibility into the aspect of the business that we have now since we exit the TSA, we believe that it will take us longer to get to the $1.53 even with our objectives of best-in-class operating margin of higher teens.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"And let me reinforce that reaching high teens as the best-in-class operating margin is our primary objective and our announced synergies are one of, if not the most important, milestone to get there.
"
Person2,"Let me also add to what <UNK> has just said and as we have said in the previous calls, that in order to achieve our EPS targets, we may also use different levers over time, including our balance sheet for strategic accretive M&A.
"
Person2,"And as you know, it's very difficult to put a precise timetable on an M&A agenda.
"
Person2,"Joe, so that's a lot of questions.
"
Person2,"So let me try to take one after the other.
"
Person2,"So first, on the cost structure, so we told you that we will make this issue a top priority, and we have.
"
Person2,"This quarter, the management team has put in place a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management result as part of our synergy program, which is expected to lead to a healthy improvement in our adjusted operating income over time.
"
Person2,"So what we have done is to significantly strengthen our cost control measures on expenses.
"
Person2,"We have also taken some measures to consolidate some commercial office facilities to gain scale and efficiency, as I said in the script, and also deploying a number of global center of excellence teams to help optimize our local operations, including the streamlining of our sales force.
"
Person2,"So some of these initiatives have already led to tangible signs of progress in the first quarter and we are going to make some further progress in the year to come, and overall profitability will make good progress even though, as we said before, the bulk of our synergies from the P&G Beauty merger have yet to be achieved and are more second half of the year skewed.
"
Person2,"It's also fair to say that I'm not sure that the Q4 was a good benchmark.
"
Person2,"Q4 results reflected certain nonrecurring costs that were not included as onetime.
"
Person2,"For example, there were a number of Coty employees who were not fully dedicated to the integration, but who worked somehow on the integration part time, and we did incur some costs related to supporting the TSA exit.
"
Person2,"So now, all of this is over because we have successfully exited all the TSA and now we can really focus on driving the business going forward.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"I'll answer all your question in more or less the order you asked me, okay.
"
Person1,"So, regarding the outlook, we expect to continue to deliver on the previously announced synergies.
"
Person1,"We're going to finalize on the streamlining of our brand portfolio and relaunch several of the key brands.
"
Person1,"And I'll get to the relaunching in a second.
"
Person1,"Now, if we take all these programs together, we aim to deliver improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, as I said, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to prior year, which means roughly flat.
"
Person1,"And when I look at the different programs that we're doing, clearly we have an improvement in the revenue trends of Consumer Beauty.
"
Person1,"That is part of the objective that I just discussed.
"
Person1,"And within Consumer Beauty, we have a couple of relaunches which are quite important.
"
Person1,"The first one is the COVERGIRL, which we just announced in October.
"
Person1,"And I mentioned an early very positive sign of reaction from the market on COVERGIRL.
"
Person1,"But we also have the relaunch of Clairol.
"
Person1,"On Clairol, we just launched a product called Color Crave, which is a hair makeup product, which we launched off the classical shelf reset windows with the U.<UNK> retailers.
"
Person1,"And clearly, we expect to gain some shelf space with this product once it's able to go in the normal shelf, plus we are going to also launch a second big innovation on Clairol in the second half of fiscal '18 and, therefore, we expect these 2 relaunches to help us improving the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty.
"
Person1,"Looking at the shelf space, I think it's important to remind that the shelf space decisions that impacted us were made prior to our acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, and the impact of those decisions continue to impact our results today and will continue for a while because we need to annualize those decision the second half of 2018.
"
Person1,"And you know that not all the retailers redo their shelf at the same time.
"
Person1,"But based on encouraging conversations that we had with retailers regarding the restaging of the COVERGIRL and Clairol and other various brands, and also sharing our innovation pipeline, we believe that we should retain most of the space for our key brands.
"
Person1,"And the last question, I think it was e-commerce.
"
Person1,"E-commerce is important for us.
"
Person1,"It's an area of focus for me and for the business.
"
Person1,"I already mentioned this in previous calls.
"
Person1,"And we don't disclose e-commerce sales, but I can confirm that we're growing at a healthy above-the-market rate in both our Consumer Beauty and Luxury division, although from a low base.
"
Person1,"I hope that I have answered all your questions.
"
Person1,"Talking about retail color, I think there is a couple of things.
"
Person1,"One of the things that I did mention in the past is this category has been always treated very, very functionally by everybody and I think this needs to be treated more as a beauty category.
"
Person1,"Now, this transformation is not immediate.
"
Person1,"And regarding our brand, Clairol, this has been a brand that didn't receive a lot of investment attention for many years, and I did refer to this brand in the past as a neglected brand.
"
Person1,"So from our point of view, we have a much stronger pipeline.
"
Person1,"I did mention one of the launches that happened in the last few months and I did kind of give you a preview that there's going to be a big launch coming in the second half of '18, but I believe that we have a very strong pipeline which covers both the functional and the beauty area, or the beauty part, of this brand and this category.
"
Person1,"And I think that our plans are strong and that's why we believe that, over time, we will be able to recover lost ground on this brand and really come back to much more positive performance.
"
Person1,"So I believe that the experience in the store and innovation are both part.
"
Person1,"And clearly, you have the communication, so the positioning.
"
Person1,"This brand also requires a bit of a different way of communicating to consumers, and we are working also on the relaunch from that point of view coming in the second half of '18.
"
Person1,"Looking at Consumer Beauty, which is what you mentioned, as I said, because we're doing all this, we believe that we have a solid strategy in place and we are excited about the relaunches of several of our Consumer Beauty brands.
"
Person1,"And that's why we aim for the net revenue trends to improve over the year.
"
Person1,"But as I said, it will still take time for a full recovery of Consumer Beauty.
"
Person2,"So on the M&A front, what I would say is that, for the time, clearly, there are some opportunities, but for the time being, our main objective is to make sure that the new Coty is delivering its ambition of best-in-class operating margin on an organic basis.
"
Person2,"And we are really focusing on deleveraging the business.
"
Person2,"So that's the current priority, that's what we're currently working on.
"
Person2,"What you should also think about is that Younique, at one point in time, is going to come on the like-for-like basis.
"
Person2,"We are going to anniversarize the partnership with Younique and that is clearly a tangible sign that, first, we are shifting the portfolio, the growth profile of the portfolio.
"
Person2,"And this is clearly going to impact positively in the second half of the year.
"
Person1,"Look, full recovery, as I said, we are defining as 2018 as a year of stabilization and that's why we believe that our sales in the second half will be roughly comparable with previous year, roughly flat.
"
Person1,"And in terms of category growth, we believe that we are exposed more or less to around 2% of growth.
"
Person1,"So over time, we expect, of course, to generate a similar level to the category growth and then, over time, to grow share as well and become overperforming versus the market that we are exposed, but we're not going to put a time line behind this path.
"
Person1,"What is important is, for us, that 2018 is giving us signs, is making us confident about stabilizing the business so that we can, therefore, take it from there and go to the next step.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"And to complement on that, <UNK>, when we speak about full recovery, we are already seeing some pockets of growth and we have already 2 legs out of 3 that are growing.
"
Person2,"The Professional Beauty business is already growing since a couple of quarters.
"
Person2,"You have Luxury that is having a very good momentum and we have commented on that and we see this momentum is continuing.
"
Person2,"Now, as <UNK> said, what we need is to focus on Consumer Beauty and here also we see some good signs.
"
Person2,"So the full recovery means that the 3 divisions will be in a much better shape and able to fight back.
"
Person2,"So that's what we mean by full recovery.
"
Person1,"So taking your first question, <UNK>, in terms of rollout of COVERGIRL.
"
Person1,"Yes, there will be some inventory destocking in the coming quarter, preparing for the arrival of all the new products, the new packaging, the new visuals on the shelf.
"
Person1,"And in terms of how we are implementing this launch, there will always be some part of the brand that will have the new innovation pipeline, which will be in and out, which means it's going to be a cut, right.
"
Person1,"And then the rest will probably be more of a phase-in.
"
Person1,"And you can understand why, depending on cost and inventory and on implementation as well.
"
Person1,"And in terms of your second question was about Burberry and regards to the inventory and when we expect some sales.
"
Person1,"As you can imagine, we only became the owner of Burberry, so we are in the process of understanding the level of stock that is in the market, so we're not able to make any comments about it.
"
Person1,"And so we expect to prepare our plans, which we're already preparing, which will be strong plans.
"
Person1,"And at some point, clearly, we will start recording sales.
"
Person1,"But I don't have a visibility to give you about the exact month when we will be able to do that because exactly of the questions you ask on the stock.
"
Person1,"Regarding the third question, <UNK>, do you want to take the one about the 6% to 8%.
"
Person2,"Yes, so the 6% to 8%, as we said, we are going to finalize this by the end of this fiscal year, this fiscal year 2018.
"
Person2,"And so we did not comment about the profitability so far of these brands and the potential EPS impact.
"
Person2,"The only thing that we said so far is that we intend to target and to offset any earnings dilution from this portfolio rationalization with the acquisition that we have made, Younique, ghd, and the Burberry Beauty license.
"
Person2,"But we did not yet comment on any timing on that.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>, for the questions.
"
Person1,"So regarding the restage of COVERGIRL.
"
Person1,"As you can imagine, it's a complicated restage.
"
Person1,"We have over 60,000 doors in the U.<UNK> -just in the U.<UNK> -where COVERGIRL is distributed.
"
Person1,"So it's a complex one.
"
Person1,"But so far, everything that we are preparing is absolutely being prepared very well, and it's going in the right direction.
"
Person1,"And yes, we're going to have an inventory reduction, as I said before in my previous answer, because that's what we're going to do to ensure that the arrival of all the new products, the new packaging, will feed faster and will phase faster into the beauty bars, the walls.
"
Person1,"And what I can tell you why we're confident is, look, since we announced the restage with the new positioning the reaction has been truly, truly positive.
"
Person1,"I mean, we did something in terms of the positioning that is absolutely relevant.
"
Person1,"And when we talk about freedom of self-expression, when we talk about creating an evolution of you with makeup, but this is truly having the right reaction.
"
Person1,"But the one that makes me more confident is reaction of our retailers, the customers, our partners.
"
Person1,"They are also the ones that are telling us that the way we are preparing this is absolutely superior to anything that has been done before by Coty.
"
Person1,"And I guess also they have visibility over what they see in the market from other brands.
"
Person1,"And this reaction makes me confident, of course, that we're going to have an increased productivity once we're able to bring the new SKUs and the new visuals in the stores as well.
"
Person1,"Your second question, I think, was about e-commerce in Professional Beauty.
"
Person1,"And look, yes, I did mention healthy growth above-market rate in Consumer Beauty and Luxury, because that's really very good.
"
Person1,"In Professional Beauty, we also have a growing e-commerce business.
"
Person1,"It's smaller, because, as you can imagine, Professional Beauty is mostly focused on salon professionals -so hairdressers, manicurists and so on.
"
Person1,"But there has been some shift as well because some of the channels are blurring.
"
Person1,"So we're working actively in this area as well.
"
Person1,"And you mentioned an app to look at how you look and, therefore, being able to look at yourself, you choose the right shade and so on.
"
Person1,"We have something absolutely like that on our brand Clairol, which is going very well, because it's absolutely one of the new way that consumers are want to engage with brands, and we have absolutely some of this technology as well.
"
Person2,"Yes, so actually to answer your first question.
"
Person2,"So that was really mainly related to the Burberry acquisition and to the related cost of this transaction.
"
Person2,"So that's really mainly Burberry related.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think your second question, <UNK>, was about the net working capital already negative, which is very good.
"
Person1,"This is a strong achievement, and we're very proud.
"
Person1,"And we're also confident that we have a bit more to go on net working capital, and we keep working on it.
"
Person1,"I think, as we said, we're still at the beginning of our journey.
"
Person1,"And we're putting in place a series of ideas and actions to improve this.
"
Person1,"So I think there is a bit more to come.
"
Person2,"Yes, and to give a little more color about that, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"So, as you know, we have $500 million synergies on the working capital.
"
Person2,"We have achieved roughly 1/3 of that so far, so it is still 2/3 to come.
"
Person2,"And this was mainly by using the levers of payables.
"
Person2,"which is on a more long-term basis.
"
Person2,"We also have to work on our inventory level.
"
Person2,"So I think it is fair to say that we still have some margin for improvement in working capital.
"
Person2,"And in Q1, what we achieved is, on average, a negative working capital, but we plan to continue on that topic.
"
Person2,"Clearly, there is still I'm quite positive about our cash flow generation.
"
Person2,"Yes, so I can -- so thanks for the questions, Steph.
"
Person2,"So I can start to answer the first one, and then I will leave <UNK> for the second part of the question.
"
Person2,"So you are absolutely correct.
"
Person2,"So the like-for-like is going to include our M&A at one point in time, at the time of the anniversary.
"
Person2,"So for Younique, it's clearly going to impact Q3 going forward.
"
Person2,"So on this, that is absolutely correct.
"
Person2,"It's going to impact 2 months of Q3 and then the full Q4.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think your second question regards -- it's more of a quarterly outlook, which we really don't do.
"
Person1,"What I can tell you is -- as we said, is -- we're going to -- we want to -- we aim to see an improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year.
"
Person1,"And in the second half, our top line, we aim to be roughly flattish or comparable to the previous year.
"
Person1,"Now when you look at the healthy margin improvement which we aim to have over the balance of the year, this is where we aim.
"
Person1,"we expect to have a more pronounced impact in Q4 given the lower base of last year.
"
Person2,"And the impact of the synergy also in Q4.
"
Person2,"So that's the combination of the 2.
"
Person2,"That's the reason why we mentioned with a more pronounced impact in Q4.
"
Person1,"On the margin, yes.
"
Person1,"So <UNK>, on your first question, which is the destocking in Q2.
"
Person1,"This -- sorry, this refers mostly to clearly some of the activities and the relaunches we're doing in the Consumer Beauty division.
"
Person1,"And it's true, we will have some destocking, but we still expect the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty to improve as a trend over the year and in the next quarters, starting from Q2.
"
Person1,"Regarding your second question, which is more of a question about the U.<UNK> mass channel, you mentioned color cosmetics.
"
Person1,"Mass channel is a really important channel for all the beauty players, and there has been some shift clearly in the way the consumers shop brands, e-commerce, specialty stores and so on.
"
Person1,"But there will always be a place for products with a strong value proposition, so for beauty brands with this characteristic.
"
Person1,"And so our focus is truly to build closer partnership with the retail customers and ensure that we create an amazing consumer experience in store and online.
"
Person1,"So this means right assortment, it means faster innovation, it means -- yes, yes, speed to market and so on.
"
Person1,"So that's where our focus is, and we're working with our retail partners to really bring back up the traffic in store through doing this.
"
Person1,"One of the things that we did recently is this new concept store in New York called the Story, which is sort of experiential playground, in which we test a lot of the digital innovation around color cosmetics in this experiential store.
"
Person1,"And what we're trying to do is to see if some of these ideas, because now we have the learnings of consumer interacting there, can go back to the classical standard retailing environment.
"
Person1,"So we are really working well to try to change this.
"
Person2,"And so on your last question.
"
Person2,"We usually don't give a split within SG&A between our fixed cost structure and our brand investment.
"
Person2,"And actually, we are seeing a decrease in Q1 fiscal '18 versus the level of Q4 fiscal '17, even if I don't think the last quarter was a good benchmark.
"
Person2,"What I can share with you is that what you should anticipate in Q2 is to have an increase in the overall level of SG&A.
"
Person2,"Not so much because of the cost structure, that should keep on declining, but much more behind the A&CP and the level of support because, of course, we're entering into a very heavy season.
"
Person2,"And it's very important that we fuel the top line momentum.
"
Person2,"So you should expect in the second quarter some increase in this overall line.
"
Person1,"Thanks <UNK>.
"
Person1,"So great question.
"
Person1,"So -- actually, it's a good opportunity for me to reiterate that our investment thesis is still very valid.
"
Person1,"So our investment thesis is that there is usually a direct relation between gross margin and EBIT across the FMCG industry, but in beauty industry, and what we want to demonstrate is that we should have -- we should be in a position to achieve best-in-class operating margin.
"
Person1,"Why.
"
Person1,"Because the level of investments that we currently have on our business is, according to us, roughly the right level of investment.
"
Person1,"There might be some difference between quarters here and there, between geographies, between segments.
"
Person1,"But overall, at Coty Inc.
"
Person1,"boundaries, the level of investment that we have is about to be the right one, which means that the overall level of synergies of $750 million should fall bottom line.
"
Person1,"This represents roughly between 700 and 800 basis points of operating margin.
"
Person1,"That's where we see the best-in-class operating margin.
"
Person2,"Over time.
"
Person1,"As I mentioned, <UNK>, we have really 2 divisions, Luxury and Professional Beauty, that have been growing for quite a while.
"
Person1,"So the key focus area of attention is Consumer Beauty.
"
Person1,"The confidence in Luxury and in Professional Beauty comes from having seen the performance of our brands in the market.
"
Person1,"I mentioned in my script that the launch of Gucci Bloom and the launch of Tiffany had been successful so far.
"
Person1,"But it's not just these 2 new product launches, we're seeing market share growth in Hugo Boss and Marc Jacobs Daisy and several other brands.
"
Person1,"So overall, our portfolio, both in terms of the classic pillars in Luxury and also the innovation it brings to market, that includes philosophy, is performing quite well.
"
Person1,"And of course, that gives us confidence.
"
Person1,"When I look at Professional Beauty, the growth that we're having in hair, which is 1 of the 2 categories that we're working in Professional Beauty, is actually positive and has been positive now for several quarters.
"
Person1,"And this is the bulk of our business.
"
Person1,"This is where we believe we are growing market share, especially in color, which is the core part of Wella Professional.
"
Person1,"And we expect to have this positive momentum and performance to continue because of the strength of our brand, but also the strength of the capabilities that we have in the Professional business, in the Professional service business.
"
Person1,"And regarding Consumer Beauty, it's really, first of all, there are some excellent results that we're seeing especially, in ALMEA, and so I mentioned Mexico, Australia, Brazil.
"
Person1,"But we also have some others -- Bourjois continues to grow market share, both in Europe but also in Russia, Middle East.
"
Person1,"We have Rimmel having market share growth in several countries.
"
Person1,"So there are several examples that clearly give us this confidence of improving trends.
"
Person1,"But as I said, Consumer Beauty will take time for a full recovery.
"
Person1,"This is clearly the largest division we have.
"
Person1,"We have faced some challenges.
"
Person1,"We continue to face some challenges, and that's why we're going to continue to implement all our actions to implement the recovery.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"So as we said, we don't give any split within the brand investment and the fixed cost structure.
"
Person2,"What I can tell you is that we made some significant progress on our cost structure, and I think the results are very telling about this.
"
Person2,"What is also true to say and what I've mentioned in one of the previous questions is that Q2, going forward, is usually a quarter where you put more money behind our brands in order to further fuel the top line, because it's clearly a quarter of a lot of activities and a very high season.
"
Person2,"But, clearly, when you compare Q4 and Q1, our overall SG&A has gone down very significantly on the back of cost structure decline and tight financial discipline.
"
Person2,"What is also fair to say is that some of the investments that we deliberately made in Q4 are yielding results.
"
Person2,"Some of them were in the Luxury division, and this has clearly paid off when I see the top line momentum that we start to see in Q1 and that's what we're targeting to see also in Q2.
"
Person1,"So <UNK>, Younique is clearly an acquisition, a very strategic acquisition that we are very pleased with.
"
Person1,"And it continues to grow double digits.
"
Person1,"So the performance that we mentioned at the time of the acquisition continues to be true.
"
Person1,"Now that is clearly under the partnership with us.
"
Person1,"In terms of additional KPIs that you asked, there is one that is very telling, which is the sign-ups or the basic recruitment of presenters.
"
Person1,"And right now, we are approaching 100,000 presenters totally, overall, with over 100,000 presenters that joined us in Q1 2018 alone.
"
Person1,"So, I guess, I think combining the net revenue double-digit growth and the growth of the presenters, that clearly makes us satisfied with the performance.
"
Person1,"In terms of the role that direct selling can play within Coty, I think that we have made, what I will call, a very strategic and successful acquisition with Younique.
"
Person1,"We are very satisfied with it.
"
Person1,"And I believe direct selling has clearly a role to play within Coty given the growing size of Younique.
"
Person1,"But the other reason why I believe that this is so relevant is because of the direct link between the presenters and the consumers.
"
Person1,"And this is very, very relevant in the current market where individualized and customized approach to consumers is a big trend.
"
Person1,"And having 100,000 presenters who are our brand ambassadors, who talk to millions of consumers out there on a daily basis, almost on an individual basis, because sometimes they do parties with -- we throw parties with few people, but most of the time is individual basis, to me is also key to the performance that we are seeing in Younique.
