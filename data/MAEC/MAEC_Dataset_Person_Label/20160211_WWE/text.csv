Person1,"We'll have an awesome WrestleMania and it will be very attractive to our audience, just as attractive as last year's.
"
Person0,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"As far as ratings are concerned, our are down, but not as much as the networks in general that we're on.

Person1,"I think you can see a decline in a lot of the networks in general because people are not watching television as much as in some capacity as online, or things of that nature.
"
Person1,"<UNK> mentioned the ecosystem.
"
Person1,"It's extremely important for us to be able to do television as well as -- television is sort of the old media, and not that it is not important to us, it's extremely important.

Person1,"And it goes back into that whole huge ecosystem and I think, again just based on sheer volume alone and sheer popularity, we are poised to take advantage in that, not just in terms of promotion but from a financial standpoint.
"
Person1,"So I think as we continue on, we're going to be more and more valuable to everybody.
"
Person1,"It sure will.
