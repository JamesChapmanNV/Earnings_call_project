Person1,"That's just the base.
"
Person1,"Assumes no additional growth.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, I wouldn't say it went quicker than we thought.
"
Person2,"It went as we expected in the beginning of -- when we provided guidance on Q1, we said we examined somewhere between $1 million and $2 million from the Ceridian business in Q1 and that's what we saw.
"
Person1,"Yeah, I would say some of that in the first quarter was driven by obviously the -- the increase in the cap, which helps our basic program revenue, where we're paid on a percentage of the face value of the order.
"
Person1,"I think that will continue for the rest of the year with the limits being up.
"
Person1,"On the new sales, new sales were strong, December to January, January to February.
"
Person1,"They continue to be pretty strong.
"
Person1,"But that would be more of a gradual rollout through the year.
"
Person1,"So, you know, so it would be reflective of kind of both of those in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"But there should be some more new sales opportunities that didn't have a full first quarter impact and some that will start in the second quarter that should give us a bit of a lift there.
"
Person1,"But, remember, my caution there is, this is great stuff, but we're talking about small employers.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Well, I think we elaborated, <UNK>, a little bit on that in the first quarter as we kind of go through our open enrollment period.
"
Person1,"You know, HSA growth for us, in the last quarter we talked about it being about 45% year-over-year.
"
Person1,"In situations on FSAs, I break those kind of into two categories, you know, where we see employers taking advantage of the carryover provision, those employers usually see kind of a low double -- 10% to 15% increase in enrollments, and we've seen that to be pretty consistent over the last couple of years.
"
Person1,"Those employers who have yet to take advantage of the carryover who are becoming smaller and smaller as a percentage of the base, those employers, are probably in the low single-digit growth rates.
"
Person1,"And then, so that -- that's really as far as we break down, you know, the growth in healthcare.
"
Person1,"HRAs, you know, still growing pretty nicely, you know, that percentage is really driven a lot by a lot of adoption that we see from employers from the standpoint of wellness initiatives and things like that.
"
Person1,"And the other thing to consider as far as timing, especially on the HSA side, you know, FSA accounts usually start January 1 and go through the year.
"
Person1,"HSA accounts, there you have employees who will enroll in an HSA account, once selecting the high deductible health plan, and we see that happening obviously quite a bit of it during the first part of the year, but that can go through the first quarter as employees enroll in new HSA accounts.
"
Person1,"I think that's going quite well.
"
Person1,"We've got a great partner we're working with.
"
Person1,"We're in the process of rolling that out.
"
Person1,"As I mentioned in my remarks, rolling that out throughout this year.
"
Person1,"We don't expect it, as I said, to have a real meaningful impact in 2016, but we should be ready to go with the vast majority of our HSA business starting on 1/1/17, so I would expect 2017 and then obviously, the years going forward, where this will be a more meaningful, if not material opportunity for us.
"
Person1,"And that's really kind of as we sit today.
"
Person1,"If there are increases in the interest rate, then I think that becomes more of a benefit to us going forward.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Sure, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"No, I wouldn't call that any pressure.
"
Person1,"I'd say, you know, overall, you know, just like it's been really in the nine years that I've been here, pricing has remained relatively flat.
"
Person1,"You know, when you're working on large enterprise-related clients, do you get more aggressive on price, sure, but, we also -- that's offset a lot by, you know, a lot of the broker business that we get on the smaller employers which tends to be at a bit higher rate.
"
Person1,"So overall, and this would be kind of across our products, I would say that we haven't seen any -- any shift that would cause any concern or make us feel like there's pressure associated with it.
"
Person2,"No, that's the big -- that's the big driver of that this quarter.
"
Person1,"Oh, sure.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, operator.
"
Person1,"Again, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today.
"
Person1,"I'd like to thank all of my colleagues throughout the company for really contributing to put our company in the position it is today.
"
Person1,"As I said, kind of in the conclusion, I really believe that our industry and WageWorks in particular as a leader in the industry, we're really at a point where we're starting to see adoption of these programs becoming greater, and I think that will continue going forward.
"
Person1,"The one given is, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses are continuing to go up, and as I mentioned earlier, from working families throughout the country, one of their own defense mechanisms against that is to take advantage of one of these healthcare accounts.
"
Person1,"So from that perspective, we see our business continuing to grow.
"
Person1,"I've talked about the benefits that we've seen on the commuter side, our COBRA business is growing quite well.
"
Person1,"We have acquisition and channel partnership opportunities we're pursuing.
"
Person1,"And package that all around the best team in the industry, who I'd like to thank for all that they do every day, I think we feel pretty good about where we're at and look forward to talking to you next quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
