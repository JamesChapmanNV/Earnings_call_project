Person0,"<UNK>, the phenomena where we see some customers making some switches to their portfolio, actually introducing heat vent where they didn't have it before in some of their products, is really a forward-looking phenomenon.
"
Person0,"We've seeing a little bit in the past year, but it will affect us more as we get through 2017.
"
Person0,"Keep in mind that when we look at switches, it's not always a lower price.
"
Person0,"There's sometimes additional content we are able to capture.
"
Person0,"Generally it's a lower price; but we view it as a positive effect more because our customer's looking at having two solutions to go to the market with.
"
Person0,"That covers more potential products that they have in the marketplace.
"
Person1,"It is going to be pretty small in the fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"The exciting thing for us is that we'll actually be shipping real product-for-sale production by the end of the year.
"
Person1,"It doesn't really start to become meaningful until 2018.
"
Person1,"If you recall, we announced that our annual run rate will be around $35 million or $40 million when it gets to full ramp up on both projects that we have, both contracts.
"
Person1,"That takes about 18 months, and that 18-month period starts at the end of this year.
"
Person0,"It's a little too early to tell right now and give a forecast of numbers and growth rates at this point.
"
Person0,"Yes, the early indications are that the first quarter has been a little bit light, driven by the North American business being some inventory adjustments.
"
Person0,"Particularly Ford and GM have backed off a little bit, and it's primarily just to adjust inventory.
"
Person0,"They ran hard in the fourth quarter, and now they had a little bit of extra stock.
"
Person0,"We don't see any indications that there is a dramatic reduction in demand.
"
Person0,"The North American marketplace is running at an all-time high rate.
"
Person0,"Frankly, customers are still buying like crazy.
"
Person0,"So we don't see any indications in the rest of the markets worldwide that would cause us to be concerned about 2017's automotive rates.
"
Person0,"Europe is still running at a good rate, but they're not running at records.
"
Person0,"The Chinese market is stabilized.
"
Person0,"They are not doing fantastic, but they are doing good.
"
Person0,"We see a generally good (technical difficulty).
"
Person1,"I think it's sequentially higher.
"
Person1,"Keep in mind that we had an easy comp and that we didn't own CSZ in the first quarter.
"
Person0,"That was going to be my point.
"
Person0,"The first quarter, we are going to be picking of a quarter from CSZ, which we didn't have last year.
"
Person0,"So you will see substantial growth for us for that.
"
Person0,"In the automotive business, I think you will see about the same as you saw in the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"We are as confused as the Trump administration appears to be about what their policies are.
"
Person0,"Our physical plant and facilities in North America are driven by a Mexican presence.
"
Person0,"That's where we have set up our business.
"
Person0,"That's the way we run.
"
Person0,"We don't really have capacities and facilities to be able to make dramatic shifts in our production.
"
Person0,"Our North American manufacturing base is primarily based upon presence in Canada for our global power systems and a large presence here in the US for our medical products division.
"
Person0,"Obviously if the rules change, we will evaluate those rules and change our strategies or adjust our strategies as necessary.
"
Person0,"From what we've seen so far, there's a lot of rhetoric about a 20% tariff on products produced in Mexico.
"
Person0,"We have a very good and strong operation in Mexico.
"
Person0,"They would be described in traditional terms as a machiladora.
"
Person0,"So lots of product materials are gathered from around the world, brought into the Mexican facilities.
"
Person0,"They are assembled, and the value added there is primarily labor and testing.
"
Person0,"Then those products are distributed to our customers in Mexico, US and in Canada.
"
Person0,"We would have to evaluate what the impact these tariffs or duties might have on our operations.
"
Person0,"Obviously, these are costs that would be passed on to our customers.
"
Person0,"So it's not exactly an easy thing to do.
"
Person0,"But it is certainly not easy for us to plan for some unknown threat of an economic war between these countries.
"
Person0,"In general, we are going to take a wait-and-see attitude and try to see what really comes out of the government.
"
Person0,"The administration is making a lot of (inaudible) noise.
"
Person0,"The full government has to vote and pass new laws, and we will review those laws and make our plans based on that.
"
Person1,"The only thing I would add to that, <UNK>, is that our manufacturing strategy has been to serve our customers locally.
"
Person1,"When we look at our facilities in China, in Asia generally -- we also have a plant in Vietnam and in Eastern Europe -- those plants do not bring products back to the North American locations from those plants.
"
Person1,"They serve those local regions.
"
Person0,"I certainly wouldn't describe the oil and gas markets as anything close to normal at this point.
"
Person0,"There's still a great depression going on in oil and gas.
"
Person0,"It's much more pronounced in oil than it is in gas.
"
Person0,"It has been described that oil is global and gas is local.
"
Person0,"Gas demand is still very strong, and it is strong by region around the world.
"
Person0,"We have adjusted our strategies to focus on markets where gas distribution and research is high.
"
Person0,"South America, Southeast Asia and a little bit into the Mid-East -- the activity there is very high.
"
Person0,"Canada and the US, the activity has flattened out a bit although the demand for natural gas is very strong.
"
Person0,"That is one of our stronger market segments in this global power unit.
"
Person0,"We do see the 2017 backlog increasing.
"
Person0,"2016 was a 100-year event in oil and gas, and we were impacted by that.
"
Person0,"We continue to be under pressure from the softness in the oil and gas businesses.
"
Person0,"We see 2017 as a stronger year.
"
Person0,"Will it achieve what we saw in 2015.
"
Person0,"I don't know.
"
Person0,"It's a very good possibility.
"
Person0,"You have to remember that business is not at all like all of the rest of our businesses.
"
Person0,"It is basically a contract business.
"
Person0,"We get contracts, we build the equipment, deliver the equipment.
"
Person0,"We can only do that when the customers are building pipelines or servicing pipelines.
"
Person0,"It's a very good business.
"
Person0,"2016 was a very bad year.
"
Person0,"2015 was a very good year.
"
Person0,"We are expecting 2017 to be somewhere probably in between.
"
Person0,"Hopefully billions and billions.
"
Person0,"We are starting with our own direct team.
"
Person0,"We will add people as the demand requires.
"
Person0,"But the United States is a very large and diverse marketplace in the medical industry.
"
Person0,"We are probably going to be adding somewhere around 15 to 30 people in total.
"
Person0,"We are well into that process now.
"
Person0,"We are very excited about the caliber of people that we are attracting and the types of opportunities that this new team is going to bring us.
"
Person1,"In our models, we use the low 20%s as we look into the 2017 period, say somewhere between 22% and 23%.
