Person,Sentence
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>, and good afternoon.
"
Person0,"Welcome to our 2015 first-quarter earnings conference call.
"
Person0,"This afternoon, we reported net income of $36 million for the first quarter of 2015, and 15.1% increase when compared to a net income of $31.3 million for the first quarter 2014.
"
Person0,"Diluted earnings per share increased 15.4% to $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2015, compared to $0.39 per share for the same quarter, a year ago.
"
Person0,"In the first quarter 2015, we had a solid loan growth of $310 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter.
"
Person0,"This brings our March 31, 2015, total loan balance to $9.2 billion.
"
Person0,"Loans increased in every category, with CRE loans increase at $177 million, commercial loans at $52 million, construction loans at $47 million, and residential mortgages by $30 million.
"
Person0,"We continue to see our loan growth in 2015, in the range of 10%.
"
Person0,"For the first quarter of 2015, our total deposits increases by $330 million to $9.1 billion.
"
Person0,"This represents an increase of 3.8% quarter-over-quarter, or 15% on an annualized basis.
"
Person0,"Our core deposits increased by $79 million or 6.95% on an annual basis from December 31, 2014.
"
Person0,"During the last quarter's conference call, we announced a signing of the merger agreement with Asia Bancshares.
"
Person0,"We are looking forward to the completion of the merger with Asia Bancshares, which we now expect to occur in the third quarter of 2015.
"
Person0,"With that, I will turn the floor over to our Executive Vice President and CFO, <UNK> <UNK>, to discuss the first quarter of 2015 financials in more detail.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>, and good afternoon, everyone.
"
Person1,"For the first quarter, we announced net income of $36 million, or $0.45 per share.
"
Person1,"Our net interest margin was 3.41% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 3.36% in the fourth quarter of 2014, and compared to 3.38% for the first quarter of 2014.
"
Person1,"In both the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 4 basis points to the net interest margin.
"
Person1,"An additional $50 million of structural repurchase agreements at 3.5% matured on January 8, 2015, adding an additional 4 basis points to the net interest margin for the first quarter of 2015.
"
Person1,"Non-interest income during the first quarter of 2015 was $8.5 million.
"
Person1,"Non-interest expense decreased by $4 million or 8.2%, to $44.1 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $48.1 million in the same quarter a year ago.
"
Person1,"The decrease was mainly due to costs associated with debt -- debt redemptions incurred in the first quarter of 2014 of $3.4 million, as well as an $835,000 decrease in the amount of employee salaries and benefits expense in the first quarter of 2015.
"
Person1,"The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was 37.3%.
"
Person1,"As the result of an investment in a renewable energy tax credit fund made on April 14, 2015, we expect that our effective tax rate for the full year of 2015 will be between 30% and 28%.
"
Person1,"The additional pretax amortization expense for these investments would be between $15 million and $18 million for the last three quarters of 2015.
"
Person1,"The second-quarter income tax provision will reflect a catch-up adjustment to reflect the lower effective tax rate for the full year 2015, resulting from the investment in the renewable energy tax credit fund.
"
Person1,"At March 31, 2015, our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio increased to 13.16%, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio decreased to 14.33%, and our total risk-based capital ratio decreased to 15.6%, as compared to December 31, 2014.
"
Person1,"Our ratios significantly exceeded well-capitalized minimum ratios under all the regulatory guidelines.
"
Person1,"At March 31, 2015, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.18%.
"
Person1,"The new Basel III capital ratio regulations reduced our risk-based capital ratios by almost 30 basis points compared to December 31.
"
Person1,"Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2015 were $332,000 or 0.004% of average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, and net charge-offs of $4.4 million in the same quarter a year ago.
"
Person1,"Our gross loan loss recovery stream in the first quarter of 2015 was $4.1 million, and our gross charge-offs were $4.5 million, all of which were from specific reserves set up in prior quarters.
"
Person1,"Our loan loss reversal was $5 million for the first quarter of 2015, compared to $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, and $0 for the first quarter of 2014.
"
Person1,"Our non-accrual loans increased by 14.5% or $10.2 million during the first quarter to $80.3 million, or 0.87% of period-end loans, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We will now proceed to the Q&A portion of the call.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Yes, Aaron, this is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We think the margin would probably decline slightly.
"
Person1,"The first quarter is a short quarter, and so for the mortgage-backed securities and loans in February, we earn a full month of interest, compared to when there's only 28 actual days.
"
Person1,"In terms of the cash levels, that is just -- it's just temporary near the end of the quarter, so the average cash levels were quite a bit lower.
"
Person1,"So that should have a fairly low impact on the margin, and then we did have more reliance on CDs in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"We borrowed $50 million from the State of California.
"
Person1,"That was at 22 basis points, and we hope to be borrowing $50 million a quarter for the rest of the year.
"
Person1,"And then we also had about $120 million of broker CDs.
"
Person1,"It was due in part to our very strong loan growth in the first quarter, and then seasonally, particularly in the month of February, we have many of our -- some of our depositors wiring funds back to mainland China or to Taiwan during the Chinese New Year holidays.
"
Person1,"So we think in the second quarter that we'll get better core deposit growth.
"
Person1,"That is something that we saw last year.
"
Person1,"And then on the loan pricing, <UNK>, maybe you want to talk about what rates we're getting on new loans in the first and second quarter.
"
Person0,"I think for the pricing, as far as pricing is concerned, we don't see any more deterioration of pricing.
"
Person0,"And typically we are, for C&I loans, we are getting Wall Street anywhere from Wall Street plus zero to Wall Street plus 0.5.
"
Person0,"And for construction loans, the pricing is much more favorable, and for that, the pricing will vary from anywhere from Wall Street plus 1 to 1.5, with floors at a higher level.
"
Person0,"And CRE loans, there has been a little bit more requests for fixed rate loans, but however, the pricing of that is -- for five years, is around about over 0.25 in that area, and for floating rate, we are getting roughly Wall Street plus 0.5, somewhere near that level.
"
Person1,"And then residential mortgage we're seeing just a slight drift each quarter, as -- mainly because we stopped making 30 year fixed rate residential mortgage, starting in March of last year.
"
Person0,"This is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person0,"As I look through the new loan book, new CRE loan book in the quarter, it's really all over the place.
"
Person0,"For example, we have loans to finance a warehouse for our import customers.
"
Person0,"We also have loans to office building, and of course, we have some for hotel.
"
Person0,"And it's really very varied in terms of category, and there's no one particular category that stand out.
"
Person1,"I think geographically, New York, the East Coast region still continues to be the fastest growing region for us in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"Right, percentage, right.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Aaron.
"
Person1,"Yes, we will not give any more guidance.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>, and I really don't see it as yet, and you may recall that our first quarter usually sees a lot of pay-down.
"
Person0,"We do see that pay-down.
"
Person0,"On the other hand, we also are booking more new loans.
"
Person0,"And as a result of that is the increase of these loans was $52 million.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, this is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person1,"What, in terms of the timing, we moved it to the third quarter, just because we're not sure.
"
Person1,"You may have seen that we filed our S-4 back in -- when was it, in early April.
"
Person1,"And then we have been notified that it's being reviewed, so that process can take -- it could take certainly at least one round of comments, and we don't know how long it takes for the SEC to actually review the response.
"
Person1,"And so that's -- if all goes well, it should close -- and then lastly, I'm sorry, we have the -- once the S-4 is cleared, under New York law, there needs to be a 20 business day period between when the S-4 is declared effective and proxy is mailed, to when the shareholder vote can occur.
"
Person1,"And then we would close -- it looks like the shareholder vote is the one that is going to take the longest time.
"
Person1,"So we hope to close shortly after that.
"
Person1,"And then in terms of buying back the stock, we have, in the S-4, there is a copy of the merger agreement.
"
Person1,"We have collars.
"
Person1,"The collars were struck back in January when the bank stocks were much lower.
"
Person1,"So the top of the collar is that $27 per share price, at the close, so we're not sure.
"
Person1,"And then the floating exchange ratio, where at least 45% of the deal would be in stock, but up to 55% will be -- but no more than 55% -- will be in stock.
"
Person1,"So, our guess is that there will be over 2 million shares issued, and we would think to buy those back, depending on the -- depending on where our stock is trading.
"
Person1,"So that's -- and we would probably do that later this year or early next year.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, we have a pipeline.
"
Person1,"I mean, just this week we had one of the B notes pay off as we viewed a series of A/B notes placed during the recession.
"
Person1,"And there is a good sized one that paid off this week.
"
Person1,"And so we have several more that are -- that may pay off in the next couple years.
"
Person1,"Most of them -- all of them are tied to commercial real estate.
"
Person1,"And we see commercial real estate being very strong, so the prospects are good.
"
Person1,"And then interest recoveries, it was 4 basis points this quarter.
"
Person1,"We see a steady stream of that.
"
Person1,"We have loans that were charged off or partially charged off a couple of years ago, or they were on non-accrual, where we applied interested collected to the principal, and so you can have a fairly small charge-off bring in almost an equal-sized interest recovery.
"
Person1,"So it's still a fairly large pipeline, but we can't predict when it happens.
"
Person1,"But given where our reserve is, any gross recovery we have will be in a negative provision, which is, that's what happened in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"It's possible.
"
Person1,"Yes, I tried to cover it in my comments, you know, the--
"
Person1,"Oh, the catch-up.
"
Person1,"Well, in ballpark, the full quarter impact would be around roughly about $0.10, and so, in EPS.
"
Person1,"And so we can see maybe $0.04 or $0.05 in Q2.
"
Person1,"The catch-up would probably be $0.02 to $0.03.
"
Person1,"That would just be the catch-up in the EPS.
"
Person1,"Yes, actually we're pleasantly surprised.
"
Person1,"At the end of 2014, we had a $1.3 billion securities portfolio.
"
Person1,"Of that, $664 million was in treasuries, which yielded 30 basis points, and we have reduced that to $350 million at the end of March, and our plan is to do more of it.
"
Person1,"And we had, at the end of December, we had $425 million of 30-year MBS, and at the end of March, we had brought that down to $17 million.
"
Person1,"And April, we sold the remaining $17 million, so we have no 30-year MBS.
"
Person1,"And you'll see in the P&L there was basically no hit -- no security losses on a net basis from reducing our interest rate exposure.
"
Person1,"And so we are, in terms of the 15-year MBS, it was $119 million in December.
"
Person1,"It's now up to, at the end of March, it's up to $743 million, and we see that going up to about $900 million in Q2.
"
Person1,"We're buying the 15-year at 3 now.
"
Person1,"We were buying the 2.5, so the 15-year 3s would be -- they would be about, maybe, maybe it's about 210 in yield, or something like that.
"
Person1,"It was mainly one land loan that had been -- that was reserved for, and so we took a small charge-off in the first quarter, and we, as a result, we had -- it was a TDR in December, and now it is non-accrual.
"
Person1,"But it's just one land loan that's well reserved.
"
Person1,"It's on the East Coast.
"
Person0,"Thank you for joining us for this call, and we look forward to talking with you at our next quarterly earnings release date.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
