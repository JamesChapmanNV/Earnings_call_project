Person0,"It is going to come down to what the stock price is at the time.
"
Person0,"We will always make that assessment.
"
Person0,"It will depend on what the likelihood if it is not 2017 what the likelihood of a deal is in 2018.
"
Person0,"So it is very difficult to give you a flavor for that as we sit here today, but we'll assess it.
"
Person0,"We are open minded.
"
Person0,"One-time dividends, changing our dividend rate going forward, it is all on the table.
"
Person0,"Nothing's off the table.
"
Person0,"We will just see what the situation is, but obviously the job -- our job is to emphasize M&A.
"
Person0,"That's what we are trying to do.
"
Person1,"And <UNK> if I could add just a little color to that, sometimes if we were looking at a large transaction that would be material non-public information which would preclude us from being out in the market buying our shares.
"
Person1,"So sometimes even if the share price looked like it was below the intrinsic value of our stock we may not be able to participate.
"
Person1,"As we know, there is a better part of the year where our window is closed for normal operating results and the timing of the window and when those are made public.
"
Person1,"But to Dave's point, M&A would be first.
"
Person1,"There is so much uncertainty right now on what the tax situation might be, not only in the U.S., but throughout Europe with the [beps] initiatives.
"
Person1,"We have no idea what type of reactions other countries might have if the U.S. makes changes in their trade policies.
"
Person1,"So I think it would cause us to really want to assess the situation carefully before jumping out in a big way.
"
Person1,"That's the credit facility in which we don't get full credit for those overseas funds.
"
Person1,"The logic there was if you brought down the debt you'd have to pay that US tax rate it has largely gone untaxed at.
"
Person1,"If overseas profits were taxed under any of the plans that are being discussed on the U.S. basis, then you have suddenly taken that off the table.
"
Person1,"And that's where you would say, okay, in that case you may -- and if interest expense, I think whether that gets grand fathered as not -- if it ever becomes non deductible, it would make interest expense a much higher priority if you had an expense that was not tax deductible.
"
Person1,"You could have debt repayment and you could be looking at dividend changes, M&A, as we discussed, and of course share buy backs are still an option.
"
Person1,"We did not acquire any shares in this quarter.
"
Person1,"We have an authorization that is available and it is approximately $20 million.
"
Person1,"So relatively modest.
"
Person1,"It is the annual acquisition that we typically will try to make to offset the dilution that comes from our stock compensation programs.
"
Person1,"But other than that we have nothing further and have not made anything in this fiscal year to date.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thanks, Bridget.
"
Person0,"I just want to thank everyone for attending the call today.
"
Person0,"We look forward to seeing you at the New York Stock Exchange on the 28th and have a great day, everyone.
"
Person0,"Take care.
