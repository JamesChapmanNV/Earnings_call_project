Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I'll make a couple of comments.
"
Person1,"If you look at what the overall category trends -- and I'll give you where we were -- if you look at the chocolate category, it was up.
"
Person1,"We were up pretty consistent with the category.
"
Person1,"If you look at non-chocolate, we actually lagged the category.
"
Person1,"And then if you looked at gum and also mint, we would have outperformed the category on those segments.
"
Person1,"We have deemphasized a little bit the level of activity that we've had in some of our sweets business.
"
Person1,"And so that certainly is showing up in the business.
"
Person1,"One brand in particular -- it was a great brand, but if we just look at the absolute programming we've had on a brand like Twizzlers, it was a little bit lower and that ended up showing up some in the overall business.
"
Person1,"If you look at the sweets business and some of the channels where it does well, you can also follow that with, I'll call it, income cohorts.
"
Person1,"And one of the things that we're doing in 2016 is using our Allan Candy acquisition to leverage a portfolio there on peg bags in select places where we think that can really benefit us.
"
Person1,"So we did see within that segment an opportunity, and we're going to try to leverage that, as well.
"
Person1,"And then some of our competitors also had emphasis on some of those brands which also would have had an influence on our performance, as well.
"
Person2,"Great.
"
Person2,"Thanks for the question.
"
Person2,"We really like where we sit right now on a leverage basis.
"
Person2,"It's something that we go back and pressure test every year.
"
Person2,"And one of the benefits that it gives us is that it gives us a lot of capacity to do something incremental.
"
Person2,"If something big and attractive and incremental came along in the category, we would be very open to it.
"
Person2,"I don't think that our leverage would be constrained in that situation.
"
Person2,"But as we sit here today with the opportunities in front of us, we feel very good about where we are.
"
Person1,"Think of Sofit as test and learn.
"
Person1,"It's a brand out of India.
"
Person1,"It's soy protein, and it's part of our efforts to learn about the protein segment, plant-based.
"
Person1,"And so you're seeing it more from a test and learn standpoint.
"
Person1,"We're going to be able to make that in the US versus, obviously, try to ship it from India.
"
Person1,"So as you know, with beverages and so forth, close to home is always a good idea.
"
Person1,"But it's a brand we think is very interesting, but it's really about us having a learning approach.
"
Person3,"And I'm delighted you found it on Amazon, because we just --
"
Person0,"Thank you for joining us today.
"
Person0,"I'll be available for any follow-up calls that you may have.
