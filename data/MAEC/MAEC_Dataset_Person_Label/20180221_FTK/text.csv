Person1,"<UNK>, we were worried about you there.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I'll talk first just briefly on your question about CICT.
"
Person1,"So 2018 is going to be what we would call a positioning and also a high-performance year for CICT, which seldom you get to do that at the same time, but the capital you mentioned is positioned for the future, and Josh will speak directly to that, then we'll come back to the international for a second.
"
Person1,"Does that answer your question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"So regarding on your second part of the 2-parter there, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Regarding international, it's still the -- the 2 or 3 main areas globally that have our most interest outside of Canada and that's always important to us, that area is really going through a tough time activity-wise in '18, I think some of the other earlier earnings calls probably spoke to that.
"
Person1,"But if you look outside of North America, it's Argentina, it's the Middle East and understanding how to penetrate what, arguably, is the third-largest fracturing market in the world, which is China, which at the same time, is one of the lowest cost structures in the world.
"
Person1,"But those are the 3 areas that we really look at.
"
Person1,"We're pleased again with the performance where we've run our technology in those areas, and we think '18 will continue to build on that.
"
Person1,"And yes, so I think that's where we are there.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Thank you, operator, and thanks for everyone's interest.
"
Person1,"As we mentioned, we'll be transparent as the quarter moves on and look forward to chatting with you again, further on in the year.
"
Person1,"Thanks for everyone's interest.
"
Person1,"Bye for now.
