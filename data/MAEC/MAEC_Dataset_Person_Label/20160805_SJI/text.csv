Person,Sentence
Person1,"I'll put <UNK> on the spot.
"
Person1,"I have great expectations and ambitions but I won't let that influence <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Good morning.
"
Person2,"Yes, there is a good robust queue that we're targeting now and again as we end contracts or put contracts in place will come on probably 2019.
"
Person2,"So it takes a couple years for negotiations.
"
Person2,"But I can't get into specifics but I'm excited about there's a few ones that are coming close and we are negotiating now.
"
Person2,"So hope to keep the new growing portfolio certainly.
"
Person0,"If I remember the numbers right, <UNK>, our target this year was to bring this landfills in at probably with maybe a total loss of about $1 million.
"
Person0,"I think that a lot of that was focused on optimizing -- a number of steps were taken to optimize.
"
Person0,"I think for the year to date they're probably right around $750,000 on the negative side which is less than half of what the number was last year through the first six months.
"
Person0,"We're still going through our optimization processes on those.
"
Person0,"We're still pretty optimistic that there's a lot of improvement that we can get out of those.
"
Person1,"As far as the Taj goes, it's disappointing that this is the outcome.
"
Person1,"I think the labor strike -- it certainly appears to be something they couldn't overcome.
"
Person1,"The optimist in me hopes that it's posturing and that they're able to come to the table and reach some kind of a settlement and reopen the Casino because I think it's in everybody's best interest.
"
Person1,"And certainly not just the workers but the overall community.
"
Person1,"As far as Atlantic City goes, again, I think, <UNK>, it's a lot of the same.
"
Person1,"There's a lot of strengthening in the market.
"
Person1,"I think the right-sizing has had the desired effect.
"
Person1,"The Casino performance, probably with the exception of the loan exception of the Taj, has year over year been improving.
"
Person1,"Again, you're seeing a diversification of the economy down there, so an increase in retail and commercial support of the Casino.
"
Person1,"We're excited be a part of it.
"
Person1,"The amount that we have that is ready for intended use is 194 and I think is was 106,000 SRECs.
"
Person1,"(laughter) You weren't kidding when you said you were going back in queue.
"
Person1,"(laughter)
"
Person1,"We should ask you what the other partners are saying.
"
Person1,"(laughter) (multiple speakers) I'll let <UNK>, who really leads our efforts here, speak to that.
"
Person2,"Our goal is in the timeline, and I believe all our partners are expecting this, as we continue to expect second half 2018 in-service dates.
"
Person2,"So certainly with the latest release with FERC, that's right in line to our timing.
"
Person2,"Next step is to get the certificate in early 2017.
"
Person2,"That all fits into a second half of 2018 start.
"
Person2,"And I believe PennEast, on their public information also says that, so that should be consistent.
"
Person2,"In terms of the cost, we're still, I think, about $1 billion to $1.1 billion in terms of what the latest forecast says for PennEast.
"
Person2,"And of course we're a 20% share of that.
"
Person2,"Still in line to what we've been saying initially, just, again, when we had to delay the pipe on our last update.
"
Person2,"But again, expectations are second half of 2018.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, what I would say is that right now the original mandate was oral arguments were to occur in September.
"
Person1,"And I think what they ended up doing was, they struggled for a date so it's now supposedly going to be at the beginning of October.
"
Person1,"That's still our expectation.
"
Person1,"That may not take that long.
"
Person1,"Frankly, from our view, the appeals, we feel really strongly about our ability to succeed against those appeals.
"
Person1,"But you would think that getting those addressed during the fourth quarter is something that we could expect.
"
Person1,"Somebody could Google that really quick.
"
Person1,"(laughter) Honestly, I don't think -- what's that.
"
Person2,"I didn't know if you were specifically asking in terms of our utility or the non-utility business.
"
Person1,"What are you looking at for this winter.
"
Person2,"Yes, the winter, from our transportation book, basis is a strong relative to the what we see in last year.
"
Person2,"Our capacity, what we're seeing, is attractive in terms of values.
"
Person2,"We're actively hedging that, locking that in to secure our budget and our forecast.
"
Person2,"But to the extent there's volatility, we'll be in a position to certainly take advantage of that with our other mechanisms of how to do that.
"
Person2,"Playing both sides of it, locking in attractive values.
"
Person2,"But if there's weather and volatility, which there always is, throughout this winter, we'll be able to take advantage of that and upgrade certain things.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, it is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We are required to file, I believe it's before the end of 2017 anyway.
"
Person0,"And obviously we've invested a lot to date.
"
Person0,"We don't have a specific date out there.
"
Person0,"We haven't talked to you about a specific date.
"
Person0,"But clearly we have a case coming up sooner rather than later.
"
Person0,"It's would not be unexpected for us to be filing earlier than the mandated late 2017 requirement.
"
Person0,"I think it was by 2017, so arguably it would be the fourth quarter there.
"
Person0,"All right, thanks.
"
Person1,"Before we wrap, up as always, please feel free to contact <UNK> <UNK>, our Director of Investor Relations, or Ann Anthony, our Treasurer, if any follow-up questions arise.
