Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, you know, again, the nuclear -- the larger orders are difficult to define sometimes in other product lines.
"
Person1,"When you get into nuclear, sometimes it gets a little more challenging, based on all the requirements that are associated with gaining final approval and moving forward, given the capital expenditures and the regulatory requirements.
"
Person1,"So, we would hope to see some in the second half of the year, but there's a chance that they can slip into 2017, just based on the requirements that take place in order to get those orders out into the market.
"
Person2,"I'm not going to get ahead of the market.
"
Person2,"We need to go through the process here, so I'll be in New York and Boston today, and tomorrow meeting with investors, and likely price on Friday.
"
Person2,"What we've said is, we do expect it to be a lower blended coupon than our current 6 7/8, but I want to respect the market process, and I don't want to speculate at this point.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, I'd say on the market front, <UNK>, it's still too early.
"
Person1,"We do pretty broad-based business in the UK.
"
Person1,"In addition to Food and Beverage, we do have Power and Energy product lines based there across the UK, both Clyde Union and our mixer business.
"
Person1,"We do some mixer business there, we do some valve business, filtration business that goes into Power and Energy.
"
Person1,"So overall, we do have an important base there for us, but we haven't seen any significant impacts thus far.
"
Person1,"Again, a little bit too difficult to predict at this stage.
"
Person1,"We would view it separately, and especially in this case, when we have customers that are doing upgrades or improving their current facilities in terms of safety performance.
"
Person1,"Some of the post- Fukushima activity that's going on that we see across the globe, and France being an area.
"
Person1,"And if you are going into Japan itself, it's where we see opportunities for these upgrades that are happening in our safety pumps.
"
Person1,"When we think about squid valves, we've again historically been tied to more new development in the market for nuclear plants in that area.
"
Person2,"Frankly, I don't really think about it that way, because the reality is, with the technical requirements in our credit facility, the absolute latest date of a refi is really May 1.
"
Person2,"Obviously, April is a quiet period, which we couldn't go to market, which leaves you from a next year window perspective.
"
Person2,"Two weeks in February and the month of <UNK>h, and so it's really depending on when you pick, when your required refinancing date [is], and it's really not, I would say, financially logical to assume the actual maturity date of those bonds.
"
Person2,"So again, we'll have more probably from a press release perspective later in the week on where the pricing lands.
"
Person2,"Right now I think, albeit it's earlier than absolutely necessary, I think that interest leakage -- the actual interest leakage that we will experience -- is very much worth it from a risk/reward perspective, over the hopefully blended nine-year term of the refinancing that we're going to market with.
"
Person2,"So I would expect the indenture to be pretty consistent with the existing bond.
"
Person2,"The covenant on the credit facility we announced that about a month ago now, early part of July, that we negotiated with our lending syndicate moved our net leverage covenant from 3 1/4 to 4 times, and so very pleased with the flexibility of the marketplace there for relatively nominal cost.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"This is <UNK> <UNK> again.
"
Person0,"This concludes our call for today.
"
Person0,"We thank everybody for joining us.
"
Person0,"I will be available on the phones all day, as normal, to answer any follow-up calls.
"
Person0,"Thanks again for joining us, and we'll talk to you next time.
"
