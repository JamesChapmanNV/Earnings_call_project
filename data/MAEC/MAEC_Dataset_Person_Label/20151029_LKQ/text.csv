Person0,"Two things on the Netherlands, Bill, that are probably worth noting.
"
Person0,"We had a really strong Q2.
"
Person0,"It was a very mild spring on the continent.
"
Person0,"And we believe a lot of that repair work may have been pushed from Q3 into Q2.
"
Person0,"And the other thing that we're doing is obviously with the heavy acquisitions we're doing from three-step to two-step, there's a lot of revenue moving as we acquire new businesses we're cannibalizing from other locations.
"
Person0,"So it may be shifting from an older location that was comping to a newer location that we didn't get the benefit of the organic growth.
"
Person0,"So we do think that's going to start to level out again and we.
"
Person0,"ll be back to where we think we should be, which is mid single-digits of organic growth.
"
Person1,"Most of it related to FX items.
"
Person1,"Yes, mostly noncash items, Bill.
"
Person1,"Again nothing material.
"
Person1,"No, the FX goes along with where the currencies are swinging and the like.
"
Person1,"So we would never kind of plan on that being a recurring item.
"
Person0,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"In the US, we get quarterly updates, but it's really moving.
"
Person0,"But it's in that 36% to 37% range.
"
Person0,"And in the UK, we're closer to 9% plus.
"
Person0,"The last figure we got from Slager at the time.
"
Person0,"Up from 7%, we got in the business, <UNK>, in 2012.
"
Person0,"We do play in that performance side of the business, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That is one of the segments we are in.
"
Person0,"We certainly would look at anything that we could obviously lever.
"
Person0,"They do have -- both of those companies have a strong e-commerce presence, which is attractive to us.
"
Person0,"But at this point, we're just looking at all of the opportunities.
"
Person0,"And since they are in that segment, we certainly would be interested in that business.
"
Person0,"The 6.2% comp.
"
Person0,"We've been told the market is growing circa GDP, so 2%-ish.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Good morning.
"
Person1,"Again, if FX rates stay where they are today, again, probably a little bit less than $0.005.
"
Person1,"On the scrap side, figure $0.02 relative to last year.
"
Person1,"I mean we continue to chunk down.
"
Person1,"And the scrap prices really didn't start to come in meaningfully until early Q1 of this year.
"
Person1,"So we won't get the real benefit.
"
Person1,"You should assume for the year that we'll be at the 34.75%.
"
Person1,"That's our best estimate at this point in time.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, on State Farm, the bumpers, the ones that they are writing in the aftermarket were up 16.6% year-over-year, so really impressive growth.
"
Person0,"We now have 467 certified parts available just in the bumper line, so very pleased with that.
"
Person0,"We talk to State Farm all the time, nothing more than that.
"
Person0,"On Australia, we keep moving forward with the partnership there.
"
Person0,"And it's a slow, steady race, but growing our top-line very nicely and expect to do a little bit more here in the coming quarters in terms of potential acquisitions and more product entry.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"It's a competitive marketplace.
"
Person0,"We're now in a position to really control that last mile of distribution.
"
Person0,"So we do still have some wholesale customers as well.
"
Person0,"So we're kind of playing in both of the markets.
"
Person0,"The car park is growing there.
"
Person0,"And it presents a great opportunity.
"
Person0,"We think that our small entry into France, we have three locations in France, provides another opportunity to keep growing the business.
"
Person0,"So we think it's a great opportunity to really grow the business in all segments of the markets we operate, the Benelux, as well as the France markets as well.
"
Person0,"We certainly believe that now that we're pretty much where we need to be in terms of the three-step to two-step, we're in a great position because our inventory is strong.
"
Person0,"We can leverage not only our existing inventory in the Netherlands, but we have backup in the UK as well.
"
Person0,"So we think we're in a great position.
"
Person0,"Remember the Coast business and our accessory business really isn't tied to collisions.
"
Person0,"It's more tied to the upgrading of the vehicle or accessorizing of the vehicle.
"
Person0,"So it's really tied to the SAAR rate.
"
Person0,"As new car sales and new RV sales continue, people are more likely to accessorize their vehicle at time of purchase.
"
Person0,"So we think we're in a great position on all side of the accessory business because of that strong SAAR rate.
"
Person0,"People are going to do this, most likely upgrade their vehicle at the time of purchase.
"
Person0,"The other thing that's attractive about that is the dealerships often finance those type of upgrades.
"
Person0,"So they roll right into the note.
"
Person0,"So we're pretty optimistic.
"
Person0,"As long as the SAAR rate stays strong, we've got a nice tailwind there.
"
Person0,"Thanks, Devon.
"
Person0,"Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning.
"
Person0,"And we look forward to speaking with you in February when we report our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
"
