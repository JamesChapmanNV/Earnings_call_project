Person2,"Yes.
"
Person3,"It's like the $64,000 question this morning.
"
Person3,"We do have -- I've not going to get into too much because we're right in the middle of the RFP, and that will be delivered here shortly.
"
Person3,"Look, whenever you go to compete, you look for an opportunity to discriminate yourself from whoever it is you are competing against, and there are multiple ways of doing that.
"
Person3,"In our particular case, we think we do it with a set of very innovative approaches to this one particular job, using commercial, well-known commercial both processes and capabilities that have not been seen inside of this space before.
"
Person3,"And then they're arrayed against some more traditional ways of solving a very similar problem.
"
Person3,"Look, I'm not giving you a lot because I don't intend to give you a lot on that subject.
"
Person3,"I believe that we have a reasonable chance at that opportunity.
"
Person3,"That's why we made the investment in talent, in the teaming that we have done, in the relationships that we have built throughout that customer community.
"
Person3,"So we'll see what happens.
"
Person3,"It wouldn't surprise me if we lost; but I'm not going to be greatly surprised if we win.
"
Person3,"We understand that job very well.
"
Person3,"We believe we understand what the customer wants.
"
Person3,"And the second part of your question had to do with -- maybe they already cut him off.
"
Person3,"If you want to come back on, <UNK>, I forget what the second part of your question was.
"
Person2,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Prior to this kind of adjustment when we on a quarterly basis rolled the backlog, we looked what was in our system and used that as the basis for the backlog.
"
Person2,"Just a bottoms-up addition of tens of thousands of line items in backlog.
"
Person2,"What we did not consider was the period of performance, and so we did not explicitly exclude items for which the period of performance has lapsed.
"
Person2,"The change we have made and is reflective of the adjustment, quite simply is if the period of performance has lapsed there is very low probability we will realize revenue; and as a result of that we are excluding it from the backlog calculation.
"
Person2,"Yes, the total acquisition revenue in the fourth quarter was $263 million.
"
Person2,"And for all of FY17, we expect it to be approximately $600 million.
"
Person2,"We attributed that to NSS.
"
Person2,"The acquired revenue on the other acquisitions is relatively small, and so we around to $600 million.
"
Person2,"Yes, that's still the right number.
"
Person2,"That's still the right ballpark.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you, Jason.

Person1,"Thanks for all your help today on the call.

"
Person1,"So this concludes our call.
