Person,Sentence
Person1,"Yes, we've got a few partnerships with a few important vendors, and also with customers as well.
"
Person1,"And that's pretty much ongoing.
"
Person1,"We will continue to grow the ALLDATA business.
"
Person1,"We feel good about ALLDATA business.
"
Person1,"We think that it's a leader in the industry.
"
Person1,"And we had signed an agreement with AMCO, you may have seen, referring to recently to provide them with service through all their locations.
"
Person1,"So it's a great product, well respected in the industry and has good prospects going forward.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Yes, and that's a very good question and that's spot on.
"
Person1,"So we were 37 basis points of deleverage due to supply chain and we had articulated a 25 to 30.
"
Person1,"So it was a little bit higher.
"
Person1,"I think part of that is really just as we continue to roll out new programs with activity.
"
Person1,"If you look at the quarter in a little bit more finite detail, we probably rolled out about 300 programs onto the program this quarter, although we took off a couple of hundred programs that got us to that net 80.
"
Person1,"So there was a lot of activity that occurred during the quarter.
"
Person1,"And as we began to ramp this up, our handling costs, our internal cost to deliver more frequently will rise a little bit.
"
Person1,"And also keep in mind that this quarter and particularly next quarter as well are slightly lower volume quarters.
"
Person1,"So we really won't have the opportunity to leverage quite as much as we might during the summer months, so to speak.
"
Person1,"So I think overall we feel pretty good about the estimates that we've given on an annualized basis, although on any given quarter they may fluctuate a little bit.
"
Person1,"Yes, it's a great question.
"
Person1,"And we do see variability.
"
Person1,"And that's the reason why we're going to go forward with a strategy that says roughly two-thirds of our stores are going to see three to five time per week deliveries, and one-third of them are going to continue to see one time a week delivery.
"
Person1,"The big variable that drives it, as you would expect, is store volume.
"
Person1,"You're talking about replenishment levels.
"
Person1,"And the more product that you sell, the more frequently you need to replenish it.
"
Person1,"And so we do see significant variability, but it's along the volume scale.
"
Person0,"I wouldn't say it would be changing the mix necessarily.
"
Person0,"I think that as the commercial business continues to grow we will continue to invest in commercial sales pros, as you call them, in the organization.
"
Person0,"I think really the comparison this year versus last is that we increased our service levels relative to where we were last year.
"
Person0,"I think last year we probably cut back a little bit more than we wanted to.
"
Person0,"I think actually, we probably might have called that out last year, that we thought our service levels weren't at the level that we wanted them to be.
"
Person0,"And so this year we didn't want to repeat that mistake.
"
Person0,"So we stuck with our model during the quarter and I think we delivered better service levels.
"
Person1,"I think as far as resetting some of those stores we talked about, we've got a new store prototype so all the new stores open will be under that prototype.
"
Person1,"We've gone back, I can't remember, I think about 126 stores that we've already remodeled on that new store prototype.
"
Person1,"And we will continue to do that.
"
Person1,"But frankly, I suspect we'll get into the hundreds of stores.
"
Person1,"I don't see that being 1000 stores necessarily because we're going to have physical constraints as we go through the process.
"
Person1,"But where we can find opportunities to add more hard parts into space-constrained stores, we're going to continue to that.
"
Person1,"It's different enough for us to justify the investment.
"
Person1,"We can debate what meaningful is.
"
Person1,"But those stores are performing better and those hard parts are moving.
"
Person0,"If I can add onto that.
"
Person0,"Number one, the new prototype is not materially more expensive than the old prototype.
"
Person0,"So as we open new stores, there's no meaningful cost differential.
"
Person0,"The real benefit comes in the really, really space-constrained stores that we have.
"
Person0,"Remember, we still have a lot of 3800 square foot stores or 5000 square foot stores.
"
Person0,"When those stores are performing at high volumes and we're able to go in and remodel them to the elements of this new prototype, that's where we can really see a differential.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Great questions.
"
Person0,"First of all on the peso, our same-store sales are domestic only.
"
Person0,"So the peso variances aren't impacting our same-store sales at all.
"
Person0,"If you look at last quarter our same-store sales did 4.5%.
"
Person0,"They did 3.5% in Q1 of 2016.
"
Person0,"You can almost point directly to the last two weeks' performance as to why that's different.
"
Person0,"And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we went up against the polar vortex last year in those two weeks, and we had phenomenal weeks.
"
Person0,"This year we had good weeks but they were up against phenomenal weeks.
"
Person0,"And that's basically the differential in our same-store sales for the quarter.
"
Person0,"We plan to open -- we opened 158 stores last year, I believe it was, 157.
"
Person0,"We plan to open about 150 stores this year on a domestic basis.
"
Person0,"We're looking to grow Mexico around 40 stores and Brazil, we're kind of taking them one at a time.
"
Person0,"It's a great question.
"
Person0,"All right.
"
Person0,"So a couple of things.
"
Person0,"Number one, when we acquired IMC just over a year ago they had 17 branches.
"
Person0,"We've now open five new branches.
"
Person0,"We stand at 22 open locations.
"
Person0,"Those IMC branches are servicing 600 AutoZone stores, but that's not a function of how many branches we have.
"
Person0,"That's a function on some short-term system limitations that we have at AutoZone to be able to serve up that catalog in our AutoZone stores.
"
Person0,"We're working -- we did some short-term solutions that have allowed us to get into those 600 stores so we can test it.
"
Person0,"Now we are having to go back and do the more robust work to industrialize those system improvements.
"
Person0,"That will be coming later in the year, which will allow us to expand how IMC services the AutoZone stores.
"
Person0,"I want to also be careful to not overstate the implications of IMC servicing AutoZone stores.
"
Person0,"Yes, we will leverage IMC.
"
Person0,"But that's not going to be the big driver of our commercial business.
"
Person0,"The reason, the main primary reason we bought IMC is because we think IMC in and of itself is a good business and we will continue to expand that business, as we've shown with the five stores that we've opened to date.
"
Person0,"Yes, if you take a look at the industry leader in the import side of the business, they've got well over 100 locations.
"
Person0,"But I don't see why we can't do the same over time.
"
Person1,"There is some of that.
"
Person1,"There is an ability for us to be able to extract some information.
"
Person1,"I think that we still have a lot of work to do relative to acquiring more information out of all of that in order to improve some of the synergies across our commercial business as well.
"
Person1,"So I would categorize it as it, is helpful on identifying certain trends.
"
Person1,"But we still have a long way to go in doing that.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Good morning.
"
Person0,"No, we haven't gone into the specific distinctions between inventory delivery frequency and mega hubs.
"
Person0,"What we continue to say is that you have both of the programs.
"
Person0,"They are going to add between $1000 and $1500.
"
Person0,"Now, that also varies because some of the mega hubs are -- the stores that are serviced by that mega hub are serviced by them three times a day directly, while other stores are serviced by other hub stores that get deliveries three times a day and then other hub stores get overnight deliveries.
"
Person0,"So there's quite a bit of variability in it.
"
Person0,"But we continue to be pretty comfortable saying if you get frequency of delivery and mega hubs, it means about $1000 to $1500 per store.
"
Person0,"It's just as simple as, number one, we wanted to go test this program until we got five up and running.
"
Person0,"We made the decision in the late summer/early September to move forward with this strategy.
"
Person0,"Now it's a function of the real estate development pipeline.
"
Person0,"And remember, I mean, even for a regular AutoZone store it can take us two years to get a store open.
"
Person0,"So it has nothing to do with anything other than our real estate pipeline and how long it's going to take us to do that.
"
Person0,"Trust me, we are pushing very hard on that front.
"
Person0,"Yes, everybody always wants us to talk about that, and we stay away from that.
"
Person0,"Unlike a lot of organizations that will have their conference call four to six weeks after their end of the quarter, it's only been two week and two days.
"
Person0,"So I think that it's not a good prudent strategy for us to talk about what's happened in the first couple of weeks.
"
Person0,"And we've been consistent about that for a long time.
"
Person0,"So I don't want to break that.
"
Person0,"Now, I will say this.
"
Person0,"Weather normalizes over time.
"
Person0,"And I also want to reiterate that a really cold winter is great, but what we really look for is just a few good, hard cold snaps.
"
Person0,"And that's when we really see big spikes in our business in certain failure-related categories.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid.
"
Person0,"We are excited about our growth prospects for the year.
"
Person0,"We will not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives.
"
Person0,"We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.
"
Person0,"As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.
"
Person0,"We thank you for participating in today's call.
"
Person0,"And we would like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy safe holiday season and a prosperous New Year.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
"
