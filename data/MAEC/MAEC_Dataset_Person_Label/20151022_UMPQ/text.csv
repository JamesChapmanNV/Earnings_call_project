Person0,"It's hard to say right now.
"
Person0,"Looking at 2016, I'd say it will be game- time decisions and we'll talk about that on a quarterly basis next year.
"
Person0,"But what we have right now, it is just one small piece in Q4 we're looking at and that's where we're at.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Let me clarify one thing, too.
"
Person0,"You're talking about contractual balances and roughly two-thirds or three-quarters of that entire portfolio came to Umpqua through acquisitions which were fair valued at the time of acquisitions.
"
Person0,"So the actual effective yields are lower on the books.
"
Person0,"And if you look at our margin table, the all-in cost is in the mid to high 3's.
"
Person0,"And, yes, they are moving.
"
Person0,"They are transitioning from Tier1 to Tier 2.
"
Person0,"There's roughly 25% left in Tier 1 this year.
"
Person0,"100% will be in Tier 2 next year.
"
Person0,"We view that as a very inexpensive form of Tier 2 capital at the holding company under Basel III.
"
Person0,"We're very comfortable with our Tier 1, including the Tier 1 common at [11.4%].
"
Person0,"So no plans at this point in time to replace those with what would be higher costing Tier 1 instruments.
"
Person0,"We're in good position on that front.
"
Person0,"They are at fair value and yields were fair valued on those as well at the date of acquisition.
"
Person0,"So if there's a 10% coupon in terms of cash coupon, the effective yield on it might be in the 7%s, right, for example.
"
Person0,"I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head.
"
Person0,"But all-in cost on that is 3.89% here for the third quarter in terms of the yield.
"
Person0,"And we view that as a very low, inexpensive and tax deductible form of Tier 2 capital under Basel III.
"
Person0,"So no plans to replace it with a higher costing Tier 1.
"
Person0,"We're in great shape with the common.
"
Person0,"No need to refinance anything out of Tier 1.
"
Person0,"We're very strong on the Tier 1 side, and actually that would be a higher cost.
"
Person0,"Correct, yes, no plans to do that whatsoever.
"
Person0,"It would be diluted earnings per share forecast as you look forward on that front.
"
Person0,"We're in good shape.
"
Person0,"You bet, thank you.
"
Person0,"Just as I talked about, I expect that just to be in the range of what you've seen in the last couple quarters.
"
Person0,"If you look at it on the face of the balance sheet, of course, it reflects the acquisition accounting from the second quarter of last year.
"
Person0,"And that's why we also, in our slide deck, show that pro forma ratio if you were to include the credit discount.
"
Person0,"But today, if we're around 80 basis points loan loss reserve, that's been inching higher over time.
"
Person0,"And I'd expect over the course of the next -- call it three, four, five years, on the face of the balance sheet, that will inch up towards somewhere in the low 1% range for the reserve while the credit discount comes off, assuming no massive downturn in the economy.
"
Person0,"But that will just probably continue to inch higher as a percentage on the balance sheet.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Appreciate it.
"
Person0,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I want to thank everyone for their interest in Umpqua Holdings and the attendance on the call today.
"
Person0,"This will conclude the call.
"
Person0,"Goodbye.
"
