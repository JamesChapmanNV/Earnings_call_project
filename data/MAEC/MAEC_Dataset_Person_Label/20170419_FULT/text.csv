Person1,"So for the year in '16, our SBA revenues were $2.2 million.
"
Person1,"I think in the fourth quarter, they were around $1 million.
"
Person1,"So the first quarter, there is seasonality in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"So we did $300,000 in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"That compared to essentially nothing in last year's first quarter.
"
Person1,"And we would expect that $300,000 as we go through the year to ramp up again like it did last year each quarter.
"
Person1,"And we do expect for the year to be probably closer to the $3 million number as compared to $2.2 million.
"
Person1,"Look, in the other income -- noninterest income, Frank, you do have the SBA gains in that line item, so that's part of the reduction that you're seeing linked quarter.
"
Person1,"We also had some branch gains in the fourth quarter relative to the sale of branches.
"
Person1,"So year-over-year, we were up 8% in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"And right now, we believe that we can be in that range for the year.
"
Person1,"We believe that we have a program in place that meets the needs and we have -- it's -- the whole process is -- gets complicated because we have 6 different regulators involved.
"
Person1,"So we are -- actually have one exam going on now, but we would expect over the next 4 to 6 months to have probably 3 more.
"
Person1,"So -- and at the end of the day, it's their decision as to whether they agree with us or not.
"
Person2,"Matt, I think the way to think about that is that within the 3.26%, you do have some impact relative to the interest income on nonaccrual loans.
"
Person2,"But other than that, I think as you look forward, that would be the way to think about it in terms of that impact on that 3.26%.
"
Person2,"We said 3 basis points.
"
Person2,"Again, it's hard to predict the amount of interest income we could have on nonaccrual loans.
"
Person2,"We don't try to forecast that but that's the element that's in that.
"
Person1,"Well, the first priority is to consolidate our charters into one.
"
Person1,"The second priority is to begin branching again.
"
Person1,"We have not added a new branch in 5 years.
"
Person1,"The third priority is to begin to consider acquisitions.
"
Person1,"But just let me remind you that we still have the Department of Justice investigation also and we don't know the timing of that, so that's a factor in all of this also.
"
Person1,"To the Department of Justice.
"
Person1,"Similar to the BSA.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So in our 5-state footprint, we operate in 52 counties.
"
Person1,"And in those 52 counties, we have a market share -- we have a market in 14 of the 52 counties, we have a market share position that's either first, second, third, fourth or fifth in 14 of the counties.
"
Person1,"So from a geography standpoint, our goal would be to look at acquisitions that would increase the number of counties where we have a significant market share.
"
Person1,"They exist in all 5 of the states that we operate in.
"
Person1,"And from a size standpoint, we would look at banks from $500 million to $6 billion or $7 billion.
"
Person1,"About $400 million.
"
Person1,"Not to date, no.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we hope you'll be able to be with us when we discuss the second quarter results in July.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
