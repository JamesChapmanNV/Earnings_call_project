Person,Sentence
Person0,"Thank you very much.
"
Person0,"I would like to welcome everyone to Mercury's second quarter conference call.
"
Person0,"I'm Gabe <UNK>, President and CEO.
"
Person0,"In the room with me is Mr.
"
Person0,"George Joseph, Chairman; and Robert Houlihan, Vice President and Chief Product Officer.
"
Person0,"On the phone we have Chris Graves, Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.
"
Person0,"Our Chief Financial Officer, Ted Stalick is traveling and is, therefore, unable to be on the call.
"
Person0,"Before we take questions, we will make a few comments regarding the quarter.
"
Person0,"Our second quarter operating earnings were $0.35 per share compared to $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2015.
"
Person0,"The deterioration in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase in the combined ratio from 98.5% in the second quarter of 2015 to 101.7% in the second quarter of 2016.
"
Person0,"Our results in the quarter were negatively impacted by $22 million of unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years, $11 million of catastrophe losses and $2 million in severance payments related to a previously announced reduction in force.
"
Person0,"The majority of the unfavorable reserve development in the quarter came from our California bodily injury coverage.
"
Person0,"The development occurred across multiple accident years with about $10 million relating to accident year 2015 and the remainder to older years.
"
Person0,"Catastrophe losses in the quarter were primarily from severe storms in Texas.
"
Person0,"Excluding the impact of unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years, catastrophe losses and severance payments, the combined ratio is 97.2% in the quarter.
"
Person0,"In California, we recorded an increase in personal auto severity in the high single-digit range during the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2015.
"
Person0,"California private passenger auto frequency was up slightly in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2015.
"
Person0,"This year for our personal auto business in California, we implemented a 5% rate increase in late March 2016 for Mercury Insurance Company and a 6.9% rate increase in June 2016 for California Automobile Insurance Company.
"
Person0,"Personal auto premiums in Mercury Insurance Company represents about half of our company-wide premiums earned and California Automobile Insurance Company represents about 15% of our company-wide premiums earned.
"
Person0,"Outside of California, our results were negatively impacted during the quarter by catastrophe losses primarily related to severe storms in Texas.
"
Person0,"Increasing loss cost trends and higher loss ratios that come with an increase in new business also negatively impacted our results in the quarter.
"
Person0,"To address possibility outside of California, we are increasing rates and tightening our underwriting.
"
Person0,"Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses, the combined ratio outside of California was about 100.3% in the quarter compared to 99.8% in the second quarter of 2015.
"
Person0,"The expense ratio in the quarter declined to 25.4% from 27.3% in the second quarter 2015.
"
Person0,"The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to lower advertising expenses, lower average commission and a reduction in profitability-related accruals.
"
Person0,"Net advertising expense in the quarter was $8.6 million compared to $12.1 million in the second quarter of 2015.
"
Person0,"Premiums written grew 6.6% in the quarter primarily due to higher average premiums per policy.
"
Person0,"Company-wide, private passenger auto new business applications submitted to the Company decreased 7.9% in the second quarter of 2016 as we focus on improving profitability in our private passenger auto line.
"
Person0,"Company-wide, homeowners applications increased 1.4% in the second quarter 2016.
"
Person0,"In California, we posted a premiums written growth of 7.8%.
"
Person0,"Outside of California, premiums written grew 1.3% in the quarter.
"
Person0,"With that brief background, we will now take questions.
"
Person0,"We still haven't made a decision on Mercury Insurance Company.
"
Person0,"We believe our rates, even after the second quarter, are in line.
"
Person0,"But we're going to be following the trends very closely, and there is a possibility that we may be filing for a small rate increase in Mercury Insurance Company.
"
Person0,"In Cal Auto we have filed for a 6.9% rate increase.
"
Person0,"That's already been filed.
"
Person0,"That's right.
"
Person0,"And keep in mind that the 6.9% rate increase in Cal Auto has not earned in at all.
"
Person0,"The MIC rate increase this quarter probably earned 25%-30%.
"
Person0,"I expect about 75% earned in the third quarter and 100% in the fourth quarter for the MIT rate increase that went into effect in March.
"
Person0,"That's correct.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"I don't recall what we said, but definitely it's high single digits now.
"
Person0,"And if you take a look at the fast-track trends in California, as an example, for the 12-month period ending March, severity for bodily injury increased 7.2% in California for BI.
"
Person0,"And pure premium, which is frequency and severity combined, increased 9.9%, almost 10%.
"
Person0,"So we're definitely seeing it in the industry as well.
"
Person0,"Property damage liability, severity up for the full-month period 6.3% for the industry, with pure premium up 8.1%.
"
Person0,"On the collision side, you're seeing 3.8% severity increases in the industry, with pure premium up 7%.
"
Person0,"So the industry is also seeing severity and some frequency increasing, so pure premium is going up quite a bit in California.
"
Person0,"Well actually the $22 million -- we increased our 2015 tax, so that increased the development about $10 million for the 15-year, Company-wide.
"
Person0,"About $3 million went to 2014 and about $4.5 million or so to 2013 and 2012.
"
Person0,"And what we're seeing -- our data showing -- is that the speed of closing on our older liability claims has increased.
"
Person0,"And we're also seeing some case reserve strengthening in our book of business.
"
Person0,"But while some of this increase case reserve and [pain loss] development was undoubtedly due to the speed up in settlements, when we take a look at one of our models, which neutralizes these changes, it basically said that we were still short.
"
Person0,"So we ended up increasing our ultimate estimate as a result.
"
Person0,"Yes, they have.
"
Person0,"They certainly have.
"
Person0,"And that's why our 2016 accident year right now, when you take out -- hopefully there's no further development and you take out some of the noise, you're running at around 97% and change when you take that out.
"
Person0,"But that's correct.
"
Person0,"We have increased our picks for 2016 as well.
"
Person0,"It has a domino effect.
"
Person0,"When you increase an older accident year and you increase the next one, the next one, the next one, it has a pretty big impact in the quarter on the calendar year results.
"
Person0,"I think that's our number one focus.
"
Person0,"And I tell you, that's -- our combined ratio is going to improve.
"
Person0,"And our target is 95% combined ratio, and the whole organization is focused on that right now.
"
Person0,"And over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, you're going to see a big improvement.
"
Person0,"You're welcome.
"
Person0,"Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning.
"
Person0,"And we look forward to talking to you next quarter with better results.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
"
