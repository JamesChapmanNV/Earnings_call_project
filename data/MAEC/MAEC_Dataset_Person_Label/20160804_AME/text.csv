Person,Sentence
Person1,"It was difficult to hear you, but I think I have your questions.
"
Person1,"The oil and gas business, as we talked before, was lower than forecasted in Q2, but stabilized.
"
Person1,"So we saw orders in that second quarter that really matched our Q3 volume level.
"
Person1,"So we feel good about that.
"
Person1,"Coming into the year, it was about a $360 million business from AMETEK, about one-third of that is upstream, one-third of that is midstream and one-third is downstream.
"
Person1,"The business is one-third US and two-thirds international.
"
Person1,"We have $120 million take down this year, so the $360 million is going to be down $120 million.
"
Person1,"That's about one-third.
"
Person1,"It's about $60 million down in upstream and $60 million down in the combination of mid and downstream.
"
Person1,"So, if you look at our upstream exposure, that's down about 60% and our mid and downstream exposure's about 20%.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"The pricing in the energy market is below the average for the whole Company.
"
Person1,"It's a very difficult environment.
"
Person1,"They have had to reduce cost to stay in business.
"
Person1,"We still can maintain pricing because we have very premier positions with niche differentiated technologies, but it's certainly not at the AMETEK level, on average.
"
Person1,"We are down a bit in the energy market, more in the upstream than the mid and downstream.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Organic orders were minus 7%, so that was in line with sales.
"
Person1,"Our EIG organic orders were down 5%.
"
Person1,"EMG organic orders were down 9%.
"
Person1,"Sure, <UNK>, I'll go around the world.
"
Person1,"In the US, we were down high single-digits versus last year.
"
Person1,"There was broader industrial weakness but the key factors driving the negative growth were oil and gas and metals.
"
Person1,"In Europe, it was down low single-digit, so we've been at that level for several quarters.
"
Person1,"Oil and gas impacted the region.
"
Person1,"But we don't have much metals exposure in Europe.
"
Person1,"In Asia, we were down mid single-digits.
"
Person1,"China was down mid single-digits.
"
Person1,"So, there was a little bit of an improvement in China, it was a better trend for Asia.
"
Person1,"We were down double-digits for three quarters in a row.
"
Person1,"Now, we are down mid single-digits.
"
Person1,"China was a negative 4%.
"
Person1,"Orders for the region, the entire Asia region, were a little bit better than the prior year, so it seems to be that Asia is stabilizing.
"
Person1,"China is stabilizing.
"
Person1,"The one emerging market that I'd point out that's doing better than the others, is India, that we have aboutmid single-digit growth in India.
"
Person1,"It's a much smaller exposure, but our investments there are paying off.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"If I look at the trends in the US, even though we are down high single-digits, it's slightly better from last quarter.
"
Person1,"Europe, that same trend is continuing.
"
Person1,"In Asia, we are improving a bit but really it's -- we don't have anything factored in.
"
Person1,"It's really a down mid single-digit.
"
Person1,"Geographic wise, it is squared with our concept of stabilization.
"
Person1,"Fundamentally, our business has stabilized.
"
Person1,"We are working on earnings growth for 2017, now.
"
Person1,"We're focused on our business.
"
Person1,"We are getting ready to go into our budgeting process.
"
Person1,"That budgeting process that we go through in Q3 and spreads into Q4, there's really no area immune from efficiency improvement.
"
Person1,"We're going to look at things like global sourcing, low-cost region production, value analysis, value engineering, plant consolidations, all the tools that we have and we are going to get a healthy cost reduction target.
"
Person1,"We're going to pair that with acquisitions.
"
Person1,"That's how we're going to grow earnings next year.
"
Person1,"So, geography is not a big factor in thinking through what we have to do for the balance of the year or what we have to do next year.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"That's direct exposure, it's not indirect exposure.
"
Person1,"So, obviously, some impact in other markets that are not oil and gas related.
"
Person1,"But that's a direct exposure and that will be down about $120 million this year.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"The total market exposure for AMETEK -- most of it is in process, but the total market expansion for AMETEK exposure, going into the year was $360 million.
"
Person1,"That's the entire exposure.
"
Person1,"I was talking about the indirect exposure, for example, you look at the helicopter market.
"
Person1,"They used to use helicopters to fly to offshore platforms, so there's less demand for helicopters.
"
Person1,"That's in our business jet and regional jet segment, that's where we report it.
"
Person1,"So, when I was talking indirect, I was talking that.
"
Person1,"The total oil and gas exposure is the $360 million.
"
Person0,"Okay.
