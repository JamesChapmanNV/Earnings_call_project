"
Person4,"You are correct that there is a lot of interest in IT enterprise work, particularly in what we would call IT consolidation.
"
Person4,"Many agencies consider that to be a major source of cost savings over the next few years for themselves and for their agencies.
"
Person4,"So we have done some strategic hiring over the last couple of years to make sure we are ready for IT modernization and indeed we are.
"
Person4,"We are bidding jobs -- I don't want to say all the time but frequently -- that call for IT modernization, IT consolidation, and we think we're in a great position to be able to help the government with those upcoming activities.

"
Person2,"If we start expanding in some customer sets that have higher proportion of fixed price or T&M, then that will increase, and that's why I think you've seen some increase over time on the federal civilian side.
"
Person2,"That said, there are more because of our focus on positions around solutions, there's potential for more fixed price type bids that we would go after, and if we're successful, which would be new to us, the net portion as we grow our top line may increase.
"
Person2,"[37.7].
"
Person2,"I don't think it will be as low as the first-quarter 2015, but compared to the fourth-quarter 2015, it will be slightly down because of fewer mandates that are available in the first quarter and the impact of the snow.

"
Person2,"And the win rates I think in that report were somewhere in the 65% to 70%, and I would certainly say that we are trending above that.
