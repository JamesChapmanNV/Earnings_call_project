Person0,"Production will be lower, <UNK>, right, because of Morris being down and the timing of that turnaround, so that's one of the things you have to factor in.
"
Person0,"That's also going to put some pressure and impact polyethylene, as <UNK> said.
"
Person0,"I think you will see that.
"
Person0,"We had some maintenance and turnarounds planned work in the second quarter, so that you will probably see hold pretty even, I think, across the quarters.
"
Person0,"We will see ethylene production being down.
"
Person1,"We said in our prepared comments that third-quarter production loss would result in about $150 million impact for the quarter.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Of course, with the $140 million you are considering the refinery in there.
"
Person1,"We are in the low- to mid-$0.60 per-pound range per annual pound of capacity.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, if you think about the improvement, probably about half of it is structural based on feedstock improvements, fixed-cost improvements and so on.
"
Person1,"The rest is more market related.
"
Person1,"Having said that, If you think about the European market there's really no new capacity coming.
"
Person1,"The euro is weaker than it was two, three years ago.
"
Person1,"We had $1.40 euro/dollar; today we're $1.10.
"
Person1,"My sense is that Europe will kind of be an insular market.
"
Person1,"I don't see a whole lot going out or coming in.
"
Person1,"With no new capacity being installed in olefins and polyolefins there, and demand growing modestly but growing some, we see a pretty balanced market.
"
Person1,"I think the operating rates ought to be reasonably high over there.
"
Person1,"I would suspect that'll be sometime back 2018 into 2019.
"
Person1,"Definitely not all of the derivative capacity has been announced yet, just like we are announcing today our polyethylene plant.
"
Person1,"I think that will balance out but on paper you would assume that it's something in the back half of 2018, 2019 range.
"
Person1,"I think the European market just has a different underpinning given the feedstock and the olefin prices there.
"
Person1,"Our sense is that, that should continue for the first seeable future.
"
Person1,"Propylene is a little bit -- (inaudible) been about flat or a little bit less than ethylene over there.
"
Person1,"I think you've got to step back and look at global pricing as well to be instructive on that.
"
Person1,"I suspect that some of it would need to go to Europe which would be the next logical destination.
"
Person1,"Europe over time will probably need propylene, so I think Europe seems logical.
"
Person1,"Of course Asia has a large need and for them it's also make versus buy because in Asia you see a lot of new PDH capacity coming.
"
Person1,"Will have to watch that.
"
Person1,"The thing we have to see is how much propylene export capacity there really is in the US and whether somebody would build more or not.
"
Person1,"I don't have a fresh view on that.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"I would think Europe would be more logical destination and then next to South America.
"
Person1,"What we see is that in a more moderate oil price environment over the medium or longer term and ethane trading somewhat above its fuel value.
"
Person1,"Construction cost being what they are in the Gulf coast, greenfield is challenging, we think, to earn reasonable returns and perhaps our return aspirations are a lot higher.
"
Person1,"I don't know.
"
Person1,"So far we'd like to see how the rest of the decade plays out before we take a really firm view on that.
"
Person1,"In the meantime, we've still got some de-bottleneck capacity that we can do.
"
Person1,"As I mentioned, we have one more we can do at Channelview.
"
Person1,"We are focused on PO/TBA and polyethylene.
"
Person1,"We have pretty healthy slate of growth projects and capital projects ahead of us.
"
Person1,"I'd like to see us execute those really well before we think about new a greenfield plant.
"
Person1,"We have announced this next 10% buyback over 18 months.
"
Person1,"We are on pace to be able to fund that.
"
Person1,"Beyond that, we'll just have to see how markets develop and what -- our view is that we have sufficient cash flow to continue to supplement our share repurchase and so on and still engage in these growth projects.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I didn't know if you had anything else to add to that.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"We have never really given perspectively information or estimates about share buybacks.
"
Person2,"As we have said, we have a new program approved for 10%.
"
Person2,"We have more than $5 billion of liquidity if you look at the committed credit facility as well.
"
Person2,"We are in a good situation to execute on the progressive dividend and on the share buyback program.
"
Person1,"I'll start and then I will turn it over to <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Generally speaking, our aim is to create value for shareholders.
"
Person1,"There's a range of options you've outlined, we evaluate those.
"
Person1,"At the end of the day, that's what we are focused on near term, midterm, long term.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I don't know if you want to add more to that.
"
Person2,"No, we are evaluating the share repurchases obviously, without options.
"
Person2,"Answering your question about how far would we go with respect to leverage, what's very important to us is to maintain a healthy balance sheet.
"
Person2,"We are focused on the BBB-plus rating as mentioned in my initial outlines and that is clearly a very much a guiding benchmark to maintain that BBB rating through the cycle.
"
Person1,"If there are no other questions then I will close with a few comments.
"
Person1,"First of all, in the near term we see markets being very strong.
"
Person1,"We see solid demand growth year over year.
"
Person1,"Planned maintenance and some unplanned outages in the industry and our planned maintenance have kept supply moderate, so we see pretty balanced markets.
"
Person1,"When we think about the cycle with some delays in new capacity, operating rates are not going to dip much below 90% on paper in the past.
"
Person1,"As we see some of these delays and even some of the CTO projects in Asia being canceled, there's a higher likelihood that 2018 effective operating rates may not dip below 90%.
"
Person1,"Our view is that we are very constructive on markets near term, medium term.
"
Person1,"We are continuing to deliver strong earnings.
"
Person1,"Last 12 months had a pace of nearly $10 per share, excluding LCM.
"
Person1,"We have a strong dividend.
"
Person1,"We're engaged in our fourth 10% share buyback program.
"
Person1,"By virtue of those two things, we are returning significant cash back to our shareholders.
"
Person1,"Our focus remains very consistent, safe, reliable, cost efficient operations.
"
Person1,"We're going to finish the Corpus turnaround and de-bottleneck it by the end of Q3.
"
Person1,"We're going continue to execute on the other turnarounds that we have.
"
Person1,"I think what all this planned maintenance activity sets us up for is a very strong 2017.
"
Person1,"We have very little turnaround activity in 2017.
"
Person1,"I think that positions us well for next year.
"
Person1,"We're starting to build out our growth project portfolio, with our polyethylene project in 2019 and potentially the PO/TBA project in 2020.
"
Person1,"We are continuing to advance those growth projects as well.
"
Person1,"We look forward to updating all of you on those items at our next call.
"
Person1,"Thanks again for your interest in our Company.
