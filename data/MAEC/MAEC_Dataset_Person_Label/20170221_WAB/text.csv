Person1,"Yes, that's right.
"

"
Person1,"Stephane Rambaud-Measson has done an excellent job pre acquisition to come to Faiveley to address some performance issues and improvement opportunities, and he was well along on that transition, put in place a strong management team around him.
"
Person1,"And those folks are a good part of the people that are running the transit business worldwide today.
"
Person1,"So they have certainly their own relationship experiences and acquisition candidates that they brought with them and I personally have already participated in three different acquisition visits with folks from the Faiveley legacy, Faiveley Executive team.

"
Person1,"We look at them as part of us.
"
Person1,"We don't say they and we anymore, and we have plenty of capacity, probably more capacity, than we had before; definitely more reach.

Person1,"Thank you.

Person0,"Thanks for everybody's attention this morning and we will talk to you in about two months with our first quarter earnings report.
