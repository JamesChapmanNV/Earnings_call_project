Person1,"Could I clarify your question.
"
Person1,"You're asking about lab in China.
"
Person1,"Our Chinese business, the first quarter was our strongest quarter of the year.
"
Person1,"We would have grown a little more the last couple of quarters, except for some tough comps on our AutoChem business.
"
Person1,"But we see no reason we can't grow high single digits in our lab business based on what I see out there.
"
Person1,"On a year-to-date basis, we're up approximately 200 basis points.
"
Person1,"Very much the lab business leading the way there with numbers actually north of that.
"
Person1,"And our industrial business is somehow being somewhat laggards to that in retail.
"
Person1,"We struggle to have global price realization in the retail business.
"
Person1,"In terms of next year, I think that we should be able to get something in the 150 basis point range.
"
Person1,"If you're wondering why a little bit less, we did make some extra moves this year, particularly driven in countries where we wanted to push through a little bit of extra pricing because of the strong dollar.
"
Person1,"For example, in places like Southeast Asia, we pushed through a little extra price increases there to try to make up for some of the currency impacts.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I would describe, first of all, a bright spot would be the lab business overall.
"
Person1,"And of course, our lab business has a slightly different mix then some of the other guys.
"
Person1,"We have a little bit less healthcare, a little bit more industrial within our product portfolio.
"
Person1,"But overall, as mentioned I think pulling out the impact of some large AutoChem orders last year, we think that can be a high single-digit business in the coming quarters.
"
Person1,"If I look at other parts of the portfolio, actually retail would be an area that has been growing there.
"
Person1,"And of course that is being driven by the increasing GDP per capita increasing consumer spending.
"
Person1,"Our industrial businesses continue to be weak overall, but we do see pockets of growth there in some specific product categories where we are trying to push product categories.
"
Person1,"But probably, they're small enough it is not so helpful for us to mention.
"
Person1,"At this point.
"
Person1,"Material costs should be down, let's say somewhere in the 1% range to 1.5% range.
"
Person1,"You can multiply that number by 0.3 or 0.4 to get a sense for what kind of impact that would have on the gross profit margin.
"
Person1,"I think I'd like to give it a range, but I would certainly say high single digits.
"
Person1,"2016 it's going to do better than that.
"
Person1,"If you look at our industrial business, we would expect, because the levels of decline are still large that it is going to take a few more quarters to stabilize that business.
"
Person1,"So, I think the beginning of the year you'll continue to see declines in our Chinese business overall.
"
Person1,"Whether we get to a flat business or modest growth business in the second half of the year I'm not quite sure yet.
"
Person1,"Definitely not materially.
"
Person1,"We have, to a certain extent, because such a high percentage of our Chinese business is Chinese manufactured products, clearly that piece will again, at least decline in the first half of the year.
"
Person1,"We have, of course, always every year a handful of products that we are transferring there, activities that we are transferring there.
"
Person1,"But I would not expect the overall percentage to move materially.
"
Person1,"Give me a second.
"
Person1,"We repurchased 390,548 shares.
"
Person1,"In terms of our industrial business overall, I think the Q3 is in line with our year-to-date numbers.
"
Person1,"We would expect to have, maybe some slowing in some of core industrial areas.
"
Person1,"But maybe some acceleration in terms of our food safety product inspection related businesses.
"
Person1,"Our lab businesses in the Americas did very well in the quarter.
"
Person1,"And we expect continued good performance in the fourth quarter as well.
"
Person0,"This year we added about 200 field resources.
"
Person0,"This -- typically they take a few quarters to ramp up in terms of the first quarter you have training, onboarding, and so on.
"
Person0,"And then, it takes them a few quarters to build up the pipeline.
"
Person0,"I would say, after two years they should actually be really profitable, contributing to the overall situation.
"
Person0,"We prioritize, of course, on product categories that have the highest profitability.
"
Person0,"And so they're going to certainly have above group average contribution.
"
Person0,"For next year, I expect, if things continue to go as expected in terms of market demand, to add about the same amount as we did this year.
"
Person1,"John you're on the line.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"They're very different.
"
Person0,"This is really pure water analytics.
"
Person0,"Totally different.
"
Person0,"The synergy is, with our [fountain] business that you might know.
"
Person0,"Particularly, related to TOC and conductivity measurements.
"
Person0,"These are the three measurement points that you would find ultra-pure water.
"
Person0,"For example, an application is water for injection.
"
Person0,"And when you have water for injections in pharma, you need to be USP compliant.
"
Person0,"And that's the [fate] parameters that are relevant here.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"You shouldn't read anything into it.
"
Person0,"It wasn't unusual for us at all.
"
Person0,"We have a certain strategy to expand the product portfolio, in terms of leveraging the access to the channel for Life Science applications and so on.
"
Person0,"But that is something we have been done over a couple of years.
"
Person0,"And what you've seen more recently was product launches for retail industrial, as well as for the last product introduction.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"Certainly not related to Ohl House, no.
"
Person0,"I don't.
"
Person0,"Everything is as usual.
"
Person1,"We built in some additional service growth over product growth.
"
Person1,"And maybe that would be the short answer, <UNK>.
"
