Person,Sentence
Person1,"Thanks, Mike.
"
Person0,"I will say, it is close.
"
Person0,"We did not see any drop-off in traffic generally, and I would not know how to parse it from the Zika virus.
"
Person0,"I will say that when you look at data points on Hawaii -- I'm sorry, on San Juan tourism, there are whole bunch of positive data points.
"
Person0,"There is a lot of positive data points on the general economy, which seems so inconsistent with all the headlines that we are reading every day about the debt problems of the country.
"
Person0,"And it is almost like they are disconnected.
"
Person0,"But in the second half of 2015 as an example, employment was up 2.5% and the unemployment rate fell almost 200 basis points to 12%.
"
Person0,"The hotel registrations in 2015 over 2014 were up almost 5%.
"
Person0,"Visitor expenditures in 2015 were up 3.6%.
"
Person0,"Cruise ship visitors were up 25%.
"
Person0,"There are incredible positive data points about tourism.
"
Person0,"Our sense is that, notwithstanding the dramatic debt crisis that's creating a lot of challenges, I mean, every time you talk about San Juan and Puerto Rico, it is like people -- you have to get over that when you first start talking to them.
"
Person0,"But the fact is that tourism has actually been trending very well.
"
Person0,"At least through 2015, again, I cannot comment specifically on the Zika virus.
"
Person0,"I don't think there's any magic number to either.
"
Person0,"If we build good, strong assets in quality locations in quality markets, then whether it is 5 assets or 10 assets, people will be attracted, capital will be attracted to those assets.
"
Person0,"And from the standpoint of human talent, our human talent will be attracted to wanting to work on those assets.
"
Person0,"So it is not three.
"
Person0,"We know that.
"
Person0,"It is not three.
"
Person0,"And how much of the assets we have to own, therefore how much capital are we actually going to put in, and how big are those assets.
"
Person0,"The Korea project, Hanam, is a billion-dollar project.
"
Person0,"So we don't have to own a billion-dollar project.
"
Person0,"We would be very happy owning 34% of that billion-dollar project.
"
Person0,"In China the projects are $350 million to $400 million, 100%.
"
Person0,"We don't want to own 100% of a project in China.
"
Person0,"We want to have a strategic partner.
"
Person0,"So it is all based on what the opportunity is, what the capital is that's required, how we capitalize it, and what else we have going on.
"
Person0,"We have three Sears stores, and that is one of them.
"
Person0,"And we obviously have talked to Seritage and to Sears' parent a number of times about all three of those stores, and we are happy to talk to them about those locations.
"
Person0,"But it takes -- we both have to be interested in pricing or terms that make sense to both of us.
"
Person0,"I don't think I want to comment specifically about any one of the stores, or what our specific negotiations are.
"
Person0,"Number one, construction cost, generally.
"
Person0,"Number two, we had very significant contingencies in the project.
"
Person0,"There were a lot of unknowns when we began.
"
Person0,"It was our first construction investment there.
"
Person0,"We felt it was prudent to put very significant contingencies there.
"
Person0,"And now it is at 70% actually built out, and it is 100% bought out.
"
Person0,"Both Shinsegae and ourselves believe that it is appropriate to reduce the overall plans for the project.
"
Person0,"We are also on the soft cost side, things like tenant allowances, are doing very well against our budgets.
"
Person1,"Yes, it is <UNK> here, in terms of bed debt, it is a little higher now than we typically trend.
"
Person1,"It is a highly variable number and hard to predict, and very tenant-specific.
"
Person1,"I would say with regard to the bad debt that we have now, or had in the quarter, you should not read anything into overall tenant health from that.
"
Person1,"It is a very, very specific to a few centers and to a couple of tenants within that center.
"
Person1,"But it is not in our view, one; a read-through for the year, and not in any way predictive or representative of overall tenant health.
"
Person0,"We are not seeing the volume of store closings that many others are anticipating, and you can see it in our occupancy and leased-up space statistics, and again I think it speaks to the general quality of our portfolio and the demand for space that I talked about earlier.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"It was a negotiated transaction.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, we said in the script that we expected $80 million of NOI from the four projects together in 2019.
"
Person1,"For the most part that is a stabilized number, you will have an extra year in there for Hawaii, but that represents stabilized -- a full-year stabilized number for the three in Asia.
"
Person1,"As to exactly how that is going to ramp over between 2016 and 2019, I don't want to give you guidance for future years before we are prepared to do that.
"
Person1,"But I think it's reasonable to think that somewhere between 10% and 15% of that number in 2016 is a reasonable number; and it won't ramp ratably over the next few years, but that's probably not a terrible proxy for how you get there.
"
Person1,"Directionally that is probably an accurate statement.
"
Person1,"If you take this year, you've got FFO -- I'm sorry, comp center NOI growth for this year, we're saying is going to be 5%, that's what is in our guidance given the positive CPI outcome.
"
Person1,"But if you look at the range of FFO that we have for this year in terms of FFO growth, at the high end of our range is about 8% FFO growth, from the midpoint it's obviously substantially less than that.
"
Person1,"And interest expense is part of the reason why that's happening.
"
Person1,"In terms of positive FFO impact or contribution, you should start to see that, certainly by 2018 and into 2019.
"
Person1,"As it relates to 2017, my guess is you are closer to neutral, but we are not at that point right now where we can give you guidance on 2017, but I think directionally what you are saying is not a crazy way to look at it.
"
Person1,"There really shouldn't be, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"They really shouldn't be a material difference.
"
Person0,"Thank you, everybody.
"
Person0,"We appreciate you joining us on our call.
"
Person0,"Obviously, if you have more questions let us know.
"
Person0,"We really do invite you to come see Xi'an, and perhaps when we get the other two open, we will make a trip.
"
Person0,"Thank you everybody.
"
Person0,"Chris, thank you, goodbye.
