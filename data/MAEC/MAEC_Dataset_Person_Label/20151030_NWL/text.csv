Person1,"So <UNK>, you're looking for the split of our A&P by new products versus core, is that what you are looking for.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"What we have learned over the last couple years, is that our investment generates the most growth yield when it's connected to innovation.
"
Person1,"So the vast majority of our investment is behind product news.
"
Person1,"And there are a couple of exceptions to that.
"
Person1,"We've done some work on Sharpie, on the core brand of Sharpie that have worked to expand consumption.
"
Person1,"But most of the investment is focused on new news, and that is what you should expect gong forward.
"
Person1,"That is certainly true on the advertising line.
"
Person1,"On consumer promotion, it's a more balanced approach.
"
Person1,"On trade promotion, more balanced approach because that's the part of A&P that is focused on activating our brands in key dry periods.
"
Person1,"So it's a balance of core and new items.
"
Person1,"So all the display material we use to get off shelf during key merchandising windows, are clearly both on the core and on the new news.
"
Person1,"So advertising is skewed very dramatically towards new news.
"
Person1,"And promotion's skewed -- or promotion more balanced across the whole portfolio.
"
Person1,"That's the logic you should have in place.
"
Person1,"I've seen plenty of ideas in businesses grow without major A& P investment.
"
Person1,"You establish a new idea, and you get great distribution on it, and you continue to activate it with great display activity, and punctuate A&P investment or advertising investment, you can do a lot to deliver sustained growth -- there are many, many examples that I can point to in my career, where you seed an idea with significant investment upfront, and then you pull back over time, and get great -- and continue to innovate in it, and get great year two, year three momentum.
"
Person1,"We are seeing that on InkJoy right now.
"
Person1,"If you look back at the spending, a year ago, two years ago, the vast majority of our writing investment went -- a good chunk went against Paper Mate InkJoy.
"
Person1,"Today our spending is focused on InkJoy new items, and not on the core proposition.
"
Person1,"So we established InkJoy.
"
Person1,"It continues to grow, and now we're punctuating spend on new items.
"
Person1,"And so, that is one of the kind of the keys to sustained growth.
"
Person1,"It's to be able to play the game the way you just described.
"
Person1,"And there are many, many examples that I could point to across all the categories that I've worked in where that has held up.
"
Person1,"Thanks very much, Lori.
"
Person1,"Thank you to you all, to all of you on the call for your interest in our Company.
"
Person1,"And most importantly, thanks to all the Newell people, who work tirelessly to make these results happen.
"
Person1,"We'll talk to you soon.
"
Person1,"Thanks.
