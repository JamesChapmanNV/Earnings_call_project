Person1,"Right.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"For 2016, I think we're still comfortable with the previous guidance that we discussed earlier in the year, which is around mid to high 70% range.
"
Person0,"And for the last couple quarters, we're in that range.
"
Person0,"And given the product mix as well as the anticipated pricing, we should still be able to maintain in that range.
"
Person1,"Yes, we -- just another comment.
"
Person1,"So, behind the scenes, we make a fair amount of investment in our manufacturing operations and cost-reduction activities.
"
Person1,"And so, the price -- we've seen pricing pressure outside the United States for a while and maybe a little bit in the US now.
"
Person1,"Yet, our margin -- profit margins have stayed the same or even gone up a little bit.
"
Person1,"And that's a little bit due to mix, but a lot to do with the fact that we're continuing to lower our manufacturing costs and the reliability of our processes.
"
Person1,"So, I just wanted to throw that other factor in there.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Chuck.
"
Person1,"To be honest with you, <UNK>, we have been pretty busy.
"
Person1,"We don't have a lot of thoughts in that area.
"
Person1,"I think, really, their viscosupplementation product has not been a real competitor for us.
"
Person1,"And so, we really haven't paid a lot of attention.
"
Person1,"We'll take a look.
"
Person1,"Maybe on the next call, you can reask that question, and we'll have some commentary.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much.
"
Person1,"And thanks to everyone who participated on the call, asked some very good question, and listened to us today.
"
Person1,"Appreciate it.
"
Person1,"We're very excited about our plans that are current underway to advance our pipeline, bring some new products to market, and drive our continued growth.
"
Person1,"And as a consequence, honestly, we look forward to updating you again on all of these activities on our next earnings call.
"
Person1,"Have a great day.
