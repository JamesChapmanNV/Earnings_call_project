Person1,"Well Tony, this park is a unique location in Tysons.
"
Person1,"In that, it already as right adjacent to it parks that we're building, jogging trails are in place, a natural stream, as well as being only a block away from the athletic fields.
"
Person1,"So the new developments don't have that sort of accessibility for people that want an active lifestyle.
"
Person1,"And we own a contiguous 45-acre accumulation of what is relatively flat and allows us to build these mid-rise apartment complexes versus the high rise requirement for those properties that are directly adjacent to the metro, they're very close to the metro.
"
Person1,"And so at this point, as we're developing and as the neighborhood is evolving, we'd like to keep control of the land at this point.
"
Person1,"Now, what we would do in the future two or three years from now, I don't want to speculate at this point.
"
Person0,"Yes, Tony.
"
Person0,"The sequential decline in G&A was largely tied to the management change that was effective July 1.
"
Person0,"So that's the primary driver.
"
Person0,"If you look at kind of the composition of the G&A for the quarter, there is really two components.
"
Person0,"The non-cash relative component that we isolate is about $900,000 and the balance is kind of the cash G&A.
"
Person0,"So that puts it somewhere in the $2.6 million all in range.
"
Person0,"I think going forward, that's probably a good fair run rate.
"
Person0,"Well, I think you know from our history, we've been very judicious about using equity as a currency and I think we would continue to do that.
"
Person0,"That would be something -- from our perspective, that would be probably more effective use as we were expanding the portfolio through acquisitions.
"
Person0,"The other thing that you have to consider if we were to issue some level of unsecured term debt, we're generating $45 million to $55 million of free cash a year.
"
Person0,"So we've got significant cash flow that we can use to pay down that debt as well, if the acquisition market doesn't change here in the near future.
"
Person0,"I think there may be a point where it would make sense, but I think just from a long-term standpoint and a dilution standpoint, it certainly would make more sense to us to use that currency for growth purposes versus refinancing purposes.
"
Person0,"We've certainly gotten some indications of pricing.
"
Person0,"I think that if we were to do something that was floating rate, we'd probably be in the range of plus or minus 100 basis points over LIBOR.
"
Person0,"So it's pretty attractive pricing.
"
Person0,"No one-time expense.
"
Person0,"The one thing that you should know and if you look in our supplemental package, we have a graph that shows kind of the trend of the margins, and you see that typically our third quarter margin is a little bit lower and that's largely driven by utility costs.
"
Person0,"So we typically see and anticipate a higher spike in utility costs over the summer months just based on that usage within the portfolio.
"
Person0,"So that was the large driver of kind of the impact on NOI.
"
Person0,"You're correct, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That is how we would expect to bring it in.
"
Person0,"And that will start coming in really early in the second half of 2017 with leased up beginning in the springtime.
"
Person1,"Yes, probably more towards the end.
"
Person1,"This is a big project, almost 400 units.
"
Person1,"And there are competitive products still coming to that market.
"
Person1,"So you're looking at more of a two-year leased up phase.
"
Person0,"Tony, just to clarify or to expand on <UNK>'s point, the construction of the entire 395-unit building will not be complete in the springtime, but the first phase of it will.
"
Person0,"So that construction will continue through close to the end of 2017.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you everyone for your time today and we look forward to talking to you in the near future.
"
Person0,"Take care, bye now.
