Person2,"Yes.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"Actually if you look at the two acquisitions -- quite a different approach.
"
Person1,"On the active cosmetic ingredients we were looking at an adjacent business to our Fragrance business.
"
Person1,"And we entered into this business because we believe that we have great top line synergies here in terms of the customer coverage.
"
Person1,"And we are playing in the premium segment of that market, which gives us an extra profitability and certainly a good growth as well.
"
Person1,"So that's important to understand.
"
Person1,"That was the reason why we ventured into that business.
"
Person1,"On the Flavors side, different approach because as we said and probably many of our competitors are telling you as well, is that you see some of the smaller, mid-size companies with higher growth rates.
"
Person1,"And we needed kind of a differentiated service model for that kind of part of the market as well.
"
Person1,"And that was the reason that we acquired Ottens to use as a platform in that segment because this way usually customers -- we were not reaching out at much as we would like to have it.
"
Person1,"And now we have the platform, we're filling the platform and we are pretty happy with it.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, it's actually more a matter of time because you really have to work through these -- the pipeline.
"
Person1,"You have to figure out what are the -- what is the real value of these assets and do they make sense from a strategic point of view.
"
Person1,"So we are certainly not, let's say, under pressure here to do it.
"
Person1,"We're really taking our time to look at these assets and then make the call if the time is ready to do it.
"
Person1,"I actually believe, in particular, in the emerging markets it's temporary because in the mid and long term you will see still, let's say, a very significant population growth and people are trending towards middle class, lower middle class.
"
Person1,"And these are all potential customers for our products.
"
Person1,"If you look at the numbers, for example Africa, Middle East is an area which is expanding double-digit for us.
"
Person1,"And you will see a doubling of the population in Africa until 2050.
"
Person1,"So it will happen.
"
Person1,"We always see these kind of spikes or [lambadas] going forward.
"
Person1,"And I'm actually very optimistic in the long range that these will stay good growth areas for us.
"
Person1,"And the good thing within IFF is, as you might know, is that we have 50% of our business in the emerging markets and 50% in the mature markets.
"
Person1,"And so that will help us when we see these markets returning to good growth.
"
Person1,"Whether we will see like in China, again, double-digit growth over years, I doubt it.
"
Person1,"But even if you see, let's say, 6% or 7% growth, I think it's still a pretty significant one.
"
Person1,"<UNK>.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, we don't have the specificity at this point.
"
Person0,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I can follow up with you offline.
"
Person0,"It will be significantly higher because that's probably where the most concentrated effort would have been in terms of the differential in reporting differences with respect to pricing related to FX.
"
Person2,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much for all your questions and have a great day.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Bye-bye.
