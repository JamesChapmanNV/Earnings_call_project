Person,Sentence
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Okay, you got me stumped on that one.
"
Person1,"Anybody around the room.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, you got it.
"
Person4,"Pardon me, I'll double check on that.
"
Person4,"But I think (inaudible) it's right now, frankly.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I think that, after concluding our Texas rate case that was approved by the commission, we had negotiated the ability to file the CTRF filing immediately.
"
Person2,"You should expect to see that from us sometime this month.
"
Person1,"Well, I would say, we're not seeing it now, but we certainly have saw it in past years.
"
Person1,"That's why we had some of the issues we had a few years ago is, we pushed through a significant amount of capital particularly associated with the re-licensing of our nuclear plants.
"
Person1,"The bottom line is, I think it's very difficult to justify more than a 2% to 3% increase in rates.
"
Person1,"And that's why we've been very cautious as we -- you heard in my remarks before, we have a lot of money we can spend in the grid and we'll go as fast as our customers and our regulators want us to go.
"
Person1,"And typically, that means an inflationary-type pace of rate increases.
"
Person1,"This is why we're so excited about steel-for-fuel, because it pays for itself.
"
Person1,"I absolutely -- we're very mindful of that, and our capital plans respect that.
"
Person1,"You're welcome.
"
Person1,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, it would start to give details around that $1.5 billion, correct.
"
Person1,"Are you talking about -- the upside, I think, that you're referring to would be the $1.5 billion of renewables that we didn't have specifically identified projects for, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Is that what you're talking about.
"
Person1,"The only thing that we had to -- we were confident in, that's why it was in the forecast -- but that we had to actually solutionize, if you will, was the $1.5 billion.
"
Person1,"Everything else is pretty much identified.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, it's <UNK>.
"
Person2,"The construct you're talking about was something we were talking about through most of 2016.
"
Person2,"When we gave you new capital guidance at EEI or on the third-quarter earnings call, we rolled all of the upside capital from that into what I call our base capital plan and that's reflective of the $18.2 billion capital plan that we now talk about.
"
Person2,"So it's all in there.
"
Person2,"That's correct.
"
Person2,"I think our rate base growth rate has us 5.5% rate base growth rate over the next five years.
"
Person1,"Well, I think, <UNK>, every time we have significant changes either to the upside or the downside, we're always going to take a look at what that means for our long-term growth rate, and update accordingly.
"
Person1,"And so as you get more time and more certainty -- and certainly what you're talking about would be execution.
"
Person1,"As I mentioned, we'll take a look at it, and we'll take a look at it if there's any tailwinds -- or headwinds, rather, that might have surfaced as well.
"
Person1,"So look for us to -- we'll continue to review that long-term growth rate.
"
Person1,"And if it needs to change, we'll change it.
"
Person1,"Well, I'm not going to get specific on the timeframe.
"
Person1,"We just continue to look at what's happened, and what we think will happen in the future.
"
Person1,"Well, I appreciate that <UNK>, because you're right, it is.
"
Person1,"And again, I think, as I've said before, our rate base growth is going to increase.
"
Person1,"But when you have things like steel-for-fuel, the pace of rate increases is modest.
"
Person1,"And that's really important, we think, to long-term success.
"
Person1,"Yes, absolutely.
"
Person2,"You're trailing away, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Well, it sounds like you like or story, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We appreciate that.
"
Person1,"We'll keep working on it for you.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Good.
"
Person1,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, we've been working closely with other -- like I mentioned, other CEOs in the industry, with EEI, the trade group, as you know and so yes, we've had some preliminary discussions, but I would emphasize the word preliminary.
"
Person1,"I think there's a long way to go with tax reform, I really do.
"
Person1,"And again, I think when we're talking about tax reform a year from now, we'll be talking about something that looks, I believe, a lot different than what's on the table now.
"
Person1,"I mean, it's just -- our industry's impacted, we think there's a way to address that.
"
Person1,"We think normalization might be that pathway.
"
Person1,"But when I think of other industries, the retail industry, et cetera, there's major potential disruption.
"
Person1,"So I'm optimistic about tax reform, but I think it will probably look a lot different than what we're talking about today.
"
Person1,"I do think the Senate is going to weigh in, and we've heard that.
"
Person1,"Well, I don't think -- if you read the commentary from key members of the Senate, I think they're saying that they appreciate what the House has done, but they're going to have their own version of what tax reform should look like.
"
Person1,"It's early.
"
Person1,"I think you'll see the House version get passed.
"
Person1,"Then the Senate will take up what I believe will be their own version.
"
Person1,"Which, my personal opinion, and based upon conversations we've had, will look a lot different than the House version.
"
Person1,"We haven't even talked about transition rules and I think there will definitely be transition rules because of the potentially disruptive nature.
"
Person1,"So I think <UNK> said in his remarks, give us a couple more quarters, let's see how things go.
"
Person1,"Things are moving fast in this Administration, but I really do think, to get it done, unless you try to jam it through in a budget reconciliation process -- and even then, I think you would be hard-pressed to get a majority of senators voting on that.
"
Person1,"I do think this is going to take some bipartisan work and I certainly hope it is a bipartisan product, because I think that's better for the country, in my personal opinion.
"
Person1,"All right, thank you.
"
Person2,"Thank you all for participating in our call this morning.
"
Person2,"Please contact our investor relations team if you have any follow-up questions.
