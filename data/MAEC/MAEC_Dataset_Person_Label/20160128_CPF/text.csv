Person,Sentence
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Let me take that question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We're pleased to report, and this was in our prepared remarks, that we completed our [Encore] branch conversion in 2015.
"
Person1,"And that's our end-to-end system for our branches, and then of course, utilized by our back office groups.
"
Person1,"Related to that there are a number of process improvements in thinking about the end-to-end process.
"
Person1,"So, we will continue to focus on being more efficient and leveraging that Encore system.
"
Person1,"The other thing is, and in earlier calls we've talked about our enterprise data warehouse.
"
Person1,"And so, we're continuing to focus on leveraging the warehouse, including the buildout of the analytics, which really is the power behind that platform -- is better understanding our customers so that we can appreciate their needs and sell into those needs.
"
Person1,"Sure, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Good morning, Alex.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, would you take that question.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Hey, Alex.
"
Person0,"There was about $350,000 of non-recurring expenses related to a buildout of a new branch.
"
Person0,"And so it's actually unrelated to the branch closure.
"
Person0,"But there was about $350,000 in non-recurring expenses in occupancy line this quarter.
"
Person1,"I'll take that question.
"
Person1,"So, yes.
"
Person1,"That was what I think of as a one-time expense.
"
Person1,"And it's related to an advertising campaign that's actually going to be launching in the next week or so.
"
Person1,"So, it's the production expenses related to that ad.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, can you take that.
"
Person2,"Hey, Alex.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK> again.
"
Person2,"As I mentioned, the fourth quarter, about $101 million was organic and about $9 million represented mainland purchases.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, do you want to take that.
"
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person2,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I think part of our growth was driven a little bit by some real estate sales, and that liquidity flowed into our deposit base.
"
Person2,"We did see one significant 1031 exchange deposit that took place at the end of the year.
"
Person2,"But the bulk of our increase in deposits really was the efforts of our people in focusing in on getting core deposit growth.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Well, maybe I'll start by talking about the buyback.
"
Person1,"So, you can expect us, with where our stock is trading today, for us to be back out in the market in Q1, and rather aggressively.
"
Person1,"And then, <UNK>, anything to add in regard to capital deployment.
"
Person0,"I think the capital plan is consistent with what you've seen over the last couple of years.
"
Person0,"So, we'll obviously pay the regular cash dividend with a yield and pay-out ratio comparable to our peers.
"
Person0,"But we'll augment that with an ongoing share repurchase program, as <UNK> mentioned.
"
Person0,"And we are obviously looking to take advantage of the recent downturn in the Street valuations.
"
Person0,"So, we will be back in the market in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, can you take that.
"
Person0,"Yes, sure.
"
Person0,"Yes, you're right.
"
Person0,"It was down slightly, $1.6 million to $1.3 million, sequential quarter.
"
Person0,"And it was primarily volume driven.
"
Person0,"So, the gain on sale margin was relatively stable for the two quarters, but we did see volume decrease by roughly 7% sequential quarter.
"
Person0,"You're welcome.
"
Person2,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Good morning.
"
Person1,"Maybe I'll start, and then I'll turn it to <UNK> to talk about the competitive environment.
"
Person1,"But Hawaii is perhaps a bit of a microcosm in regard to how we think about the national economy.
"
Person1,"And so, in fact, the tourism numbers that we saw for last year were a record for us, and the spend remained high.
"
Person1,"So, currently, for -- as we think about 2016, we are expecting a strong year.
"
Person1,"I mentioned the unemployment numbers that were announced recently for December, 3.2%, which is the lowest rate in eight years.
"
Person1,"So, we are expecting a strong economy here in Hawaii, as we think about the tourism numbers and then also as we look at construction in the state.
"
Person1,"<UNK>.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I think with regards to the two banks, I'll take maybe American Savings first.
"
Person2,"I think they've been doing business as usual.
"
Person2,"They've been focusing on their activities.
"
Person2,"And we haven't seen any significant change in their efforts thus far.
"
Person2,"I think for First Hawaiian Bank, it's really early to tell if there's going to be any, or there has been any significant changes in the way they operate their business.
"
Person2,"As you know, they did make that announcement late December.
"
Person2,"So, given the market conditions and given the fact that it's, again, very early in the ballgame -- I just think it's too early to tell what kind of moves they're going to be making going forward.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"So, <UNK>, on the new volume yields on the investment side, we have been investing.
"
Person0,"In the fourth quarter, we did come in on the duration scale slightly.
"
Person0,"So, new volume investment yields probably averaged about 2% in the fourth quarter relative to the portfolio yield dollars, more like 2.60%.
"
Person0,"On the loan side, it was a lot better story, much closer.
"
Person0,"New volume yields were much closer to the overall portfolio.
"
Person0,"Overall portfolio yield on -- overall new volume yields was about 3.70%, weighted average of 3.70% versus a portfolio yield of roughly 3.85%.
"
Person0,"No problem, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Allison.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much for participating in our earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2015.
"
Person1,"We look forward to future opportunities to update you on our progress.
"
