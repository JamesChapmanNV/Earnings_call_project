Person1,"<UNK>, do want to handle that.
"
Person3,"We'll break down the components of the same-store for the second quarter.
"
Person3,"Overall we are at 6.3%.
"
Person3,"And where that came from was rent bumps and cash increases are, what, 3%.
"
Person3,"The drop in free rent was about 2.5%.
"
Person3,"And as you mentioned on the expenses, the other major contributor was a drop in the landlord expenses.
"
Person3,"And the real estate tax refund, that was about another 60 basis points.
"
Person3,"Going forward, we still have some opportunity on the real estate tax refunds, but it may not be quite as much as we've seen in the past.
"
Person2,"And then, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"In the second-quarter outperform, that caused us to raise the midpoint of our same-store guidance by about 50 basis points.
"
Person2,"That's a little over $1 million or about $0.01 a share.
"
Person2,"Again this is actual compared to our guidance.
"
Person2,"About half of that, or $500,000, is due to lower bad debt.
"
Person2,"Again, we budget about $750,000; that came in at $225,000.
"
Person2,"And the other $0.005 had to do with lower landlord expenses, and a little bit of pickup on same-store average occupancy compared to plan.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, the other part, the main part of the drop was just overall utilities.
"
Person2,"Landlord utilities was a big factor in there, too, also.
"
Person2,"Correct.
"
Person2,"I think the math that we are getting, <UNK>, is if you look at our midpoint guidance of 5%, and you back out our first two quarters of actual, you get a little over 3% same-store growth.
"
Person2,"That's basically comprised of rental rate bumps and increases in rental rates.
"
Person2,"Now, the first half of the year, we got the benefit of free rent burning off that we're not getting the benefit for the second half of the year.
"
Person2,"Now, keep in mind, there could be some other upside potential as we had in the first two quarters.
"
Person2,"For third quarter and fourth quarter, we've budgeted $750,000 each quarter for bad debt expense.
"
Person2,"If we come in the same as the first quarter and the second quarter, which is about $200,000, our same-store would go up roughly about 80 basis points.
"
Person2,"So that's the construct of what we're looking like for the back end of the year.
"
Person1,"I'll have <UNK> jump in on that.
"
Person1,"But we feel very good about what we're seeing in Southern California.
"
Person1,"We're very excited about The Ranch in the Chino/Eastvale market, submarket.
"
Person1,"We've had great success and we've got a great team.
"
Person1,"And <UNK>, why don't you talk about that.
"
Person1,"But I would expect that if we can find more product, we would continue to do it.
"
Person1,"We do it and we have great success.
"
Person1,"Let me add one more thing -- and <UNK> can talk about it -- we also have again a wonderful site that can accommodate about a 1.4 million square feet that is -- you might talk about that.
"
Person1,"So we are bullish on Southern California.
"
Person1,"And now you should expect us to continue to be pretty bullish on that.
"
Person1,"Now, don't be rude like <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I mean, that (multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"I would say we're very encouraged.
"
Person1,"We have narrowed down the candidate list.
"
Person1,"And again leadership is the number-one thing.
"
Person1,"But we are very excited about it and we've got great candidates, and we're making good progress.
"
Person1,"But other than that, we're not going to say anything until we announce something.
"
Person1,"But we are very confident that we'll have my replacement in place prior to the end of the year.
"
Person1,"My successor, exactly.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"Let me have <UNK> handle that.
"
Person4,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person4,"In Minneapolis, you're correct; we have some opportunity there.
"
Person4,"Most of our vacancies are in the Northwest submarket, a series of different buildings ranging in size from about 25,000 feet to 221,000 square feet.
"
Person4,"That Northwest submarket has seen a fair amount of new supply, and absorption has been a little bit slower; so, certainly competitive.
"
Person4,"But we have continued to make progress on the smaller 25,000 to 30,000 square foot spaces.
"
Person4,"But we still have work to do on getting the larger of those, particularly the 221,000 square foot space, done.
"
Person4,"But we're confident in our team's ability to do that and drive the occupancy up there.
"
Person4,"And then in St.
"
Person4,"Louis, which has been a pretty consistent performer for us, we have a couple of spaces there that certainly meet the market from 25,000, 50,000, 100,000 square feet.
"
Person4,"And we have work to do.
"
Person4,"But those spaces have been occupied, and again we have confidence in our team's ability to have them reoccupied.
"
Person1,"As far as 2017, we'll give you when we do the 2017 guidance.
"
Person1,"And we'll report at that time.
"
Person1,"<UNK>.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, one quarter does not really make a trend.
"
Person3,"And we actually said in our comments, we talked about the renewal sign and commencing in all of 2016.
"
Person3,"That overall cash rental rate increase is 6.1%.
"
Person3,"And then you also heard that right now we only have 2% or 1.4 million square feet of the portfolio is rolling the remainder of the year.
"
Person3,"So that's -- again, that one quarter just doesn't really make a trend.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, there was one transaction.
"
Person1,"They already brought that down.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, do want to take that.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, do you want to take that.
"
Person1,"Make sure you execute on your developments and we are executing [free up] new capacity.
"
Person1,"And <UNK>, again if we have a build-to-suit, that doesn't count because that's --
"
Person2,"And <UNK>, that includes the four starts that we presented on the call -- the four new stores in third quarter and fourth quarter, as well.
"
Person1,"(multiple speakers) Park 94.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, you want to take that.
"
Person1,"Yes, on Southern California, the big -- let's do our property (multiple speakers) our $1.4 million (multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"And The Ranch land is a lot more expensive.
"
Person1,"Great.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you for joining us on the call.
"
Person1,"If you have any questions, as always, please call <UNK>, <UNK>, or myself, and we'd be happy to answer them.
"
Person1,"And we appreciate your interest in First Industrial.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
