Person1,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"No, it's an accounting issue that any increase or decrease in your stock price has an impact, in terms of your carrying costs, associated with those assets.
"
Person1,"So any increase you'd have in your operating expenses, you'd have a decrease in other income, and vice versa.
"
Person1,"So, it is from a P&L perspective, no impact, whatsoever.
"
Person0,"We've had some initial discovery, which has been just very straightforward, looking at the data underlying the case.
"
Person0,"And there's been really, almost no public discussion about the case.
"
Person0,"We are, obviously, communicating what we're doing, and why.
"
Person0,"But there really has not been much conversation about it.
"
Person0,"I would like to think, that in part, that's simply a result of the fact that gas bills have been trending down so consistently for the last 10 years, and we've done a very good job managing those costs for customers.
"
Person1,"I think we'll speak from our perspective, the most recent ROE from our perspective, is from the hydro case, was 9.8% ROE.
"
Person1,"No, what I wanted to be very, very clear on that, is, just because we didn't include the slides this time, that they are going to change.
"
Person1,"They're not going to change.
"
Person1,"We didn't really have anything, incrementally, to tell you on this call associated with that.
"
Person1,"So that's why they weren't included.
"
Person1,"And now that I'd known there's been this many questions, I would have had <UNK> keep them in.
"
Person1,"(laughter)
"
Person1,"Oh, its been a tradition everyone loves every year now (laughter).
"
Person1,"And yes, we will give you -- we call them the drivers.
"
Person1,"We will give you the drivers at EEI.
"
Person0,"Way to sell tickets <UNK>.
"
Person0,"(laughter)
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Well thank you all, again, for your interest here at the end of the quarter.
"
Person0,"We certainly are pleased with where we are right now.
"
Person0,"And it sounds like we'll be seeing many of you in just a couple of weeks.
"
Person0,"Take care.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
