Person2,"I think, <UNK>, you've hit on exactly the right point there, which is, for us, the hardware revenue drives the higher-margin attach and the recurring revenue.
"
Person2,"And <UNK> <UNK>, I'll turn it over to you to kind of describe those pieces.
"
Person2,"But when we're talking about the additional revenue streams, you are talking about adding professional services, implementation services.
"
Person2,"You've obviously got the hardware and software maintenance on the recurring piece.
"
Person2,"Those are all drivers.
"
Person2,"So, don't get me wrong, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"We're laser focused on margin within hardware and being as efficient as we can.
"
Person2,"But for us, it's about driving those more profitable revenue streams.
"
Person2,"I do think you'll see 2017 as the new product introductions that <UNK> talked about roll out, you'll see hardware margins start to flatten as opposed to decreasing.
"
Person2,"<UNK>.
"
Person4,"You captured it on attach, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"For hardware, as <UNK> said and we talked about earlier, it comes down to scaling the volumes on the new models and then the incremental cost reduction that we'll drive this year.
"
Person4,"We have a very intense focus on cost, not only just for a solution going out the door but also for the total cost of ownership through its lifecycle.
"
Person4,"So, that is an intense focus for us and we expect to see improvement this year.
"
Person3,"Thank you all for joining us today and we'll see you in April.
