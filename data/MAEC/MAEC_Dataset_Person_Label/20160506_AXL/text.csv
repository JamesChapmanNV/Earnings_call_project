Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We have one in our backlog at this point in time that launches in the 2018, 2019 period of time.
"
Person0,"At the same time, we're reporting a significant amount of opportunity that is going to be post-that, so more like the probably 2019 to 2022 period of time.
"
Person0,"But there are some significant opportunities with a plethora of different customers that are there.
"
Person0,"Content per vehicle is really going to range anywhere between $500 to $2,500 depending on the customer and what type of technology they are looking for based on it is scalable, and it's all feature-based based on the customers' specifications.
"
Person1,"From a platform perspective, no.
"
Person1,"They were still strong and in our favor for that mix.
"
Person1,"We do have annual pricing also from first quarter of last year to this year would be other element of that.
"
Person1,"But principally you hit the main points.
"
Person1,"So we would be up 6%, 7% or so based on those elements you just added back.
"
Person0,"Starting with your last question, yes, we expect to see change in a positive direction going forward through the balance of this year.
"
Person0,"And as we said, we are still quoting on activity that's really production source or SRPs in the 2018-2020 period of time, but those decisions are being let now.
"
Person0,"So that is positive in that respect.
"
Person0,"The first part of your question is we picked up some non-GM business on a brand-new platform that we don't participate in today.
"
Person0,"It covers more of our driveshaft technology.
"
Person0,"It is where it is, which is positive for us.
"
Person0,"At the same time, we picked up some other driveline business.
"
Person0,"So those are the favorable benefits that contribute to the move from 35% to 50%.
"
Person0,"We're going to see more increase in regards to our pass car and cross-over vehicle as we've mentioned to you in the past.
"
Person0,"We will see more balance in the mix of our product portfolio between truck and SUV and pass car and cross-over vehicle.
"
Person0,"Our backlog alone has got well over 70% of the backlog is passenger car and cross-over vehicle, and a lot of what we are holding today is passenger car and cross-over vehicle.
"
Person0,"Again, as I mentioned earlier to you in regards to our R&D activity, we're trying to design things that are scalable across truck, SUV and pass car, where they can be, so we can try to drive economies of scale and performance while keeping our R&D costs down in certain areas.
"
Person0,"So, overall, I think our engineering organization is doing an outstanding job providing products that meet the market needs and the different vehicle segments and it's clearly a growth opportunity for us in regards to the cross-over vehicle.
"
Person0,"And then you factor in what we're doing now in the electrification space, I see that as all positives for the Company.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"There's one other real significant issue that's pertinent to your question.
"
Person2,"That's our manufacturing processes.
"
Person2,"Many of our manufacturing processes are highly flexible and transportable between passenger car applications and truck applications.
"
Person2,"In fact, we've rebalanced gear processing equipment, featuring equipment, forging cruxes for that matter, any number of different activities.
"
Person2,"The one area where we have dedicated processing is on the assembly line.
"
Person2,"But even within our assembly lines, we've designed common stations that can be and have been in fact recently moved from truck to car applications.
"
Person2,"So we've got a substantial amount of process similarity that we can leverage in our operations as well.
"
Person0,"We've built flexibility into our operations.
"
Person0,"No longer do we have transfer lines and all of that.
"
Person0,"We've got flexible component machining, flexible gear operations, and then we've designed our assembly systems as best we can to be flexible based on the stations that <UNK> had indicated earlier.
"
Person0,"So we've got flexibility built into our operations while also trying to drive standardization into the product.
