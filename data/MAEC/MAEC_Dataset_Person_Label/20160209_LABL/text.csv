Person0,"In revenues, you mean.
"
Person0,"So none of the divestitures were from acquisitions.
"
Person0,"We haven't divested any businesses.
"
Person0,"The beverage business that <UNK> referred to is some business that we exited, and that is business that we have had for many, many years, low-margin beverage business that is from our legacy Multi-Color businesses.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Specifically, in any given quarter, any given year, pricing varies between -1% and +1% impact on revenues.
"
Person1,"This fiscal year, since the Q2 and Q3 it continued to be a -1% impact on the topline.
"
Person1,"And that is slowly starting to reduce as we work through those new arrangements.
"
Person1,"It is fair to say that we've re-contract several large customers in the middle of last calendar year.
"
Person1,"That is great for us in terms of stability in medium term, but has involved some short-term price concessions.
"
Person1,"And we are feeling the effect of that in Q2 and Q3, and that will continue to tail off in future quarters.
"
Person1,"Well, if we continue to see disappointing quarters, then we won't do anything.
"
Person1,"But on the basis that we can see improvement in our current book of business and make acquisitions, we think acquisitions do add meaningful value, both financially and strategically.
"
Person1,"If we did not acquire, we would not be able -- if we were just a North American business today we would not be able to defend our global customer business that we have in North America easily.
"
Person1,"And secondly, we'd miss out on opportunities to add a lot of value and miss the boat in terms of being a genuine global player in the space and the leveraging of customers and best practices and procurement that that provides.
"
Person1,"So, done well, we think they have and can continue to add good value.
"
Person1,"But we are not going to do it, come hell or high water.
"
Person1,"We are going to do it because it makes financial sense and in a manageable way.
"
Person1,"Thank you, everybody, for attending and your questions this morning.
"
Person1,"We are focused on improving our quarterly results going forward and, fundamentally, we don't see that there is any significant change to the environment that we operate in.
"
Person1,"These are self-inflicted, short-term challenges and we will work through them and move forward.
"
Person1,"And we look forward to talking to you again next time around.
"
Person1,"Thank you for your time.
"
