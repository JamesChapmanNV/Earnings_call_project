Person0,"Good questions.
"
Person0,"So, first of all, let me address the first part on the apparel question that you're getting at.
"
Person0,"As you know, we're pretty dominant in apparel right now with our Maxx and Marshalls businesses in the states.
"
Person0,"I would tell you that a lot of our Sierra Trading Post business is apparel that we'll be looking at.
"
Person0,"There's nothing on the plate right now in terms of another brand, in terms of apparel, but that's not to say never.
"
Person0,"We're always looking and innovating and testing and lots of ideas around here.
"
Person0,"And, I would tell you that it's not that idea has not come up.
"
Person0,"I would say we've toyed with different versions, but as you know, we're pretty methodical in that we don't want to do too many things at once.
"
Person0,"If you're us, what we're looking at right now is we have a high degree of confidence in our Australia business, which is a full-line store.
"
Person0,"Very much what we do, apparel-driven.
"
Person0,"We like the way our Maxx and Marshalls is going.
"
Person0,"We're looking at where we think we are most underpenetrated from opportunity potential is in our home arena in the US.
"
Person0,"It just screams at us.
"
Person0,"Obviously, and you're aware of all the success.
"
Person0,"So, we are bullish.
"
Person0,"We're bullish in terms of some of the apparel parts of the Sierra Trading Post expansion, and we're bullish about those stores specifically.
"
Person0,"And, getting at that, we've put a new infrastructure in place, a planning organization in place, and we've actually put some systems in place that are going to allow us to handle those apparel and non-apparel areas in a much more TJX way of shipping and selling the goods.
"
Person0,"So, I know -- I don't think I'm totally answering your question about where do we see apparel going, but I think you were trying to get the lay of the land, so to speak.
"
Person0,"I can't really comment specifically on our family of business like that.
"
Person0,"But, it's a good question.
"
Person0,"Very good question, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"(laughter)
"
Person0,"I guess we have taken our last call.
"
Person0,"And, we would say, again, we've been very excited to have this time with you today.
"
Person0,"Thank you all for joining us.
"
Person0,"We look forward to updating you on our first-quarter earnings call in May.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
