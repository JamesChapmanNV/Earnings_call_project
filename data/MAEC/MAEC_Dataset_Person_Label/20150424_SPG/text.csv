Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"No worries.
"
Person1,"Well, I think the retailers, as they bring in the omnichannel world to their physical stores, will certainly apply it to the outlet world as well.
"
Person1,"Again there are all at different degrees of that integration.
"
Person1,"But I don't think outlets would be ignored on that front at all.
"
Person1,"So, I would expect that to be part of it.
"
Person1,"Well, look, put it this way, I'm not surprised by Land and Buildings and Orange's -- that they might pursue something like this, or others.
"
Person1,"But as you can see from their proxy materials, we are not participating or providing any financial support in their proxy.
"
Person1,"But I'm not surprised that someone like them would take up this particular issue.
"
Person1,"But again, we're not -- this is not us; this is them.
"
Person1,"And I said to you, you can see it from their preliminary proxy stuff that we are not supporting or involved in that at all.
"
Person1,"As a shareholder, we will wait and see what happens.
"
Person1,"Well, look, that's up for Macerich to respond to.
"
Person1,"I mean I can only tell you what I told you earlier, which is I think we put a hell of a deal on the table, and I was looking to engage with Art.
"
Person1,"I consider Art a peer.
"
Person1,"We've had a good relationship.
"
Person1,"People say hostile offer.
"
Person1,"I don't -- let me give you my thinking on this.
"
Person1,"Any time somebody offers a lot of money to somebody, I never consider that hostile.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Now it may not be -- it may be unsolicited.
"
Person1,"But it ain't hostile.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"It ain't hostile.
"
Person1,"So I hope Art and the Board realizes that I didn't view it as hostile.
"
Person1,"I view it -- sure, it was unsolicited, but it was a hell of an offer done in the spirit of trying to negotiate a deal at a big number.
"
Person1,"And I'll leave it at that.
"
Person1,"It's yesterday's news.
"
Person1,"But I'll leave it at that.
"
Person1,"But it was not hostile.
"
Person1,"Unsolicited, absolutely.
"
Person1,"But again anytime I think -- I'm a simpleton when it comes to this -- but anytime you offer a big number to somebody I don't view that as hostile.
"
Person1,"I just view that as the way of the world, I guess.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"No worries.
"
Person1,"All right, thank you, everyone, and take care and we will talk to you soon.
