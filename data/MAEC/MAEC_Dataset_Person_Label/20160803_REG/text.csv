Person,Sentence
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, it will really depend on if we have -- if any other investment opportunities.
"
Person3,"We still have some equity to put to use.
"
Person3,"But to the extent that can find acquisitions or increase the size of our development pipeline, and we would think about funding that not with -- just not just with equity but potentially with new debt, and also potentially with property sales.
"
Person3,"And it will depend on really the capital markets at that time.
"
Person3,"Because right at this moment, there's no need for additional debt.
"
Person1,"Tremendous amount of flexibility, as both <UNK> and I indicated.
"
Person4,"Well, we own several larger community shopping centers.
"
Person4,"We have a great property in Raleigh, North Carolina, an iconic shopping center that we've owned for well over 10 years.
"
Person4,"We redeveloped an iconic property, made it iconic, in Westlake in Southern California.
"
Person4,"So community shopping centers, some of whom -- some of which have some lifestyle components, have been a part of our strategy long term and will continue to be.
"
Person4,"But I would still say that it's in the 20%-plus percent range today as a percentage of NOI.
"
Person4,"And it may go up some, but not substantially.
"
Person4,"As we said often, our strategy is community and neighborhood shopping centers, and will continue to be so.
"
Person3,"We don't -- the renewal also was the bittersweet.
"
Person3,"It was actually Barnes & Noble.
"
Person3,"So we did -- there is significant upside in that rent, even after.
"
Person3,"Renewal option was even a large increase.
"
Person3,"What we had underwritten was that it was going to be down for little while, while we replaced it with a better operator.
"
Person3,"Such that it was bittersweet.
"
Person3,"We kept the income at a higher rent, but now we have to wait, I believe, the renewal was for five years.
"
Person3,"So now we have to for another five years in order to replace that tenant.
"
Person3,"Beyond that, we do have -- so Washington Sports Club is also a short-term renewal.
"
Person3,"And we anticipate that we will have the opportunity to replace that as well at a higher rent
"
Person4,"And we have the right to terminate when we find a replacement operator.
"
Person3,"And then the other upside is really -- it comes from smaller spaces.
"
Person3,"And then the redevelopment of the vacant parcel.
"
Person3,"I'm a female.
"
Person3,"We don't think north, south, east, west.
"
Person3,"It actually -- so the front door today actually comes out to Clarendon Boulevard.
"
Person3,"So it's facing the Barnes & Noble.
"
Person3,"We could potentially reconfigure that so that that the door could face the Whole Foods and do ground-floor retail so that it is -- it does have Clarendon exposure.
"
Person3,"We think that there's incredible amount of upside there.
"
Person4,"It really does sit on the pin corner of the property.
"
Person3,"So Cheesecake Factory is down the other -- I guess that would be, it's toward DC, I know that -- no, it's the other way.
"
Person3,"It's opposite DC.
"
Person3,"It's down the other end.
"
Person3,"Very well could be restaurants.
"
Person3,"But I wouldn't anticipate it being a large-use restaurant like that.
"
Person3,"I would anticipate smaller, and have some outdoor seating because there is a little bit of a courtyard there.
"
Person3,"But again, we are in the really early stages.
"
Person3,"We did give ourselves some time to really explore what would be the best long-term use
"
Person1,"Throughout the project we expect to be able to add some additional excellent restaurant operators.
"
Person1,"We think that's a real opportunity there.
"
Person1,"And just to note, the parcel that's available is an old Sears, which is, as <UNK> and <UNK> indicated, is strategically located on the site.
"
Person3,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We appreciate your time and interest in Regency.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much.
"
Person1,"And everybody have a great day, and the rest of the week.
"
Person1,"And if you're in hot weather, stay cool.
"
