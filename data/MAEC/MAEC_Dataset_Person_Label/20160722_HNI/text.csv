Person0,"Good morning, everyone.
"
Person0,"We'll share our assessment of the second quarter of 2016, provide some thoughts on our outlook for third-quarter and full-year 2016, and then open it up for questions.
"
Person0,"I've very pleased with our year-to-date profit performance.
"
Person0,"We delivered a 34% increase in non-GAAP earnings-per-share on 5% lower sales.
"
Person0,"Gross profit has improved significantly, driven by strong operational material productivity.
"
Person0,"We are clearly realizing the significant financial returns for our investments, including our Business System Transformation initiative.
"
Person0,"Our businesses are strong, and we expect to deliver record non-GAAP earnings-per-share in 2016, while still continuing to aggressively invest and position our businesses for continued long-term profitable growth.
"
Person0,"We're on track with our goal to double our earnings every three to five years, and feeling great about that.
"
Person0,"So, for the second quarter, non-GAAP earnings-per-share increased 28% on 6% lower sales.
"
Person0,"Sales results for the quarter were as we expected.
"
Person0,"Office furniture sales were down 5%, down 7% on an organic basis.
"
Person0,"Sales of the supply-driven channel were up 1%, or down 2% on an organic basis.
"
Person0,"Sales in our other office furniture businesses, which include North American contract and international, were down 11%.
"
Person0,"Our North American contract business was down [9%].
"
Person0,"Our art sales decreased [8%].
"
Person0,"Strong continued growth in the new channel -- the new construction channel continued with sales increasing [8%].
"
Person0,"Sales in our hearth retail channel were down 23%.
"
Person0,"During the quarter, dealers with our Majestic, Monessen Vermont Castings brands adjusted their buying patterns and inventory levels.
"
Person0,"As a result, sales of our retail [non-pellet] products were down 18%.
"
Person0,"So let me explain a little bit.
"
Person0,"Our industry-leading operational capabilities provides a more efficient delivery model with better cash flow for our dealers.
"
Person0,"These dealers are reducing their inventory levels and realizing the timing of their seasonal orders to the back half of the year.
"
Person0,"Our retail pellet products, which represent 4% of our sales in the second quarter, were down 52% due to the impact of warm weather and lower energy costs.
"
Person0,"So, overall, I'm very pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and first half of the year.
"
Person0,"I'll turn it over to <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Additional financial highlights for the second quarter include non-GAAP consolidated gross margin of 39.9%, was an improvement of 340 basis points versus the prior-year.
"
Person1,"These results were driven by strong operational and material productivity and price realization, which was partially offset by lower volume.
"
Person1,"Non-GAAP selling and administrative expenses were down versus the prior-year due to cost reductions at both the operating segments and Corporate, partially offset by the impact of incentive-based compensation and acquisitions.
"
Person1,"As we look to the third-quarter 2016, we anticipate consolidated sales to be up 3% to flat.
"
Person1,"On an organic basis, consolidated sales are forecasted up 1% to down 2%.
"
Person1,"Office furniture sales are expected to be up 4% to flat.
"
Person1,"And organic office furniture sales will be up 2% to down 2%.
"
Person1,"Supply-driven office furniture sales are projected to be up 6% to 9% or up 3% to 6% organically.
"
Person1,"Sales in our remaining office furniture businesses are forecast to be down 3% to 6%, and sales in our North American contract business are expected to be flat to down 3%.
"
Person1,"Part sales are expected to be up 3% to down 1%.
"
Person1,"New construction channel sales are forecasted to be up 6% to 9%, and sales in our remaining hearth businesses are expected to be down 3% to 6%.
"
Person1,"Within those remaining part businesses, we are projecting retail non-pellet sales to be up 3% to flat, and retail pellet sales to be down 16% to 19%.
"
Person1,"Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately the same as the second quarter of this year when it was 39.9%.
"
Person1,"Non-GAAP SG&A is expected to be approximately 20.5%.
"
Person1,"So our estimate of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter is now in the range of $0.90 to $0.95 a share.
"
Person1,"So for the full-year 2016, our current best assessment of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is now in the range of $2.80 to $2.95 a share.
"
Person1,"We expect consolidated sales to be down 1% to 3%, in line with our prior guidance.
"
Person1,"We are forecasting office furniture sales to be down 1% to 4%, and sales in our hearth business for the year expected to be flat to down 3%.
"
Person1,"<UNK>.
"
Person0,"All right.
"
Person0,"Well, thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I'll wrap up here.
"
Person0,"Our businesses are strong and well-positioned for the future.
"
Person0,"Our brands are competing well in their respective markets.
"
Person0,"We continue to identify investment opportunities that will deliver strong financial returns in the future.
"
Person0,"I'm confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value.
"
Person0,"So with those comments complete from <UNK> and myself, we'll now open it up to questions.
"
Person0,"Well, first off, <UNK>, as <UNK> indicated to you, our guidance for the remainder of the year on topline is consistent with prior guidance.
"
Person0,"So, we're seeing the overall market kind of behaving as it did the last time we addressed this or spoke about it -- there's no real change there.
"
Person0,"The upgrade in the guidance is just continued strong execution, operational performance.
"
Person0,"And we are believing that's going to continue as we go forward.
"
Person0,"I'll let <UNK> address the interest.
"
Person1,"Yes, I don't think interest changed, <UNK>, in our outlook.
"
Person1,"We refinanced our credit agreement in April and took out some private placement debt with a revolver that has lower financing.
"
Person1,"But I would say that was all incorporated in our full-year -- our quarter and full-year guidance.
"
Person1,"So, to <UNK>'s point, it's really driven by that strong operational performance which we've seen through the first half of the year and continuing through the back half.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I wouldn't think about it too differently than we've talked in the past, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I would think of office furniture 25 percentage points or so -- you know, that can be plus or minus a few; and hearth, we've said --
"
Person0,"Of leverage.
"
Person1,"Of leverage.
"
Person1,"And hearth operating leverage in the 30% to 35% range on kind of a normalized basis.
"
Person1,"And then you are exactly right -- the add is those structural cost takeouts on top of it.
"
Person1,"And I think what we said last quarter -- or a couple of quarters before -- remains similar to today, our outlook.
"
Person1,"We said we'd start to see a modest amount of benefit here in the back half, really the fourth quarter of 2016, and kind of 50% to 60% in 2017 of that $35 million to $40 million that we had laid out at run rate by 2018.
"
Person1,"So I think it's pretty consistent with what we've talked in the past.
"
Person1,"But you're -- if you're thinking about how you layer that up, you're on the right track.
"
Person1,"I'd probably skew it more as it builds through the year as you think about it.
"
Person1,"But I -- so, that would be my direction.
"
Person0,"Next year.
"
Person0,"So experiencing strong growth in new construction channel -- liking that a whole lot.
"
Person0,"Interesting sort of dynamics around this supply chain destocking -- or whatever term you might want to use -- of the acquired Vermont Castings dealers, which includes Monessen, Majestic, and Vermont Castings brands.
"
Person0,"So we -- one of our strengths in the hearth business is really an outstanding ability to deliver products, through a manufacturing capability and a distribution capability, closer to time of order.
"
Person0,"So that allows the dealers to not -- they don't have to take early buy inventory and hope and pray it sells through, because they're able to take it as they order it.
"
Person0,"And that creates tremendous opportunities for improved cash flow for the dealers, and we become stickier with them as well.
"
Person0,"So that's all good.
"
Person0,"And then the -- so that's going to work through; that should work through between now and the middle of next year, I would say.
"
Person0,"And then the other is this pellet decline.
"
Person0,"So it's just a dramatic decline.
"
Person0,"It ran up dramatically the previous 24 months and now it's running down dramatically.
"
Person0,"And I would say we're getting down towards the bottom of where I think that's going to settle out.
"
Person0,"That's probably another -- through this burn season, so the middle of next year, it should start to annualize there.
"
Person0,"And it's becoming a smaller and smaller portion of our business, so it has less and less impact.
"
Person0,"So, to answer your question again is, I would say the middle of next year, <UNK>, is when we should start to see all this stuff kind of reach an equilibrium.
"
Person0,"And we'll feel the full benefit of the new construction growth and less of the downdraft from sort of supply chain inventory positions and the negative draft from pellet declines.
"
Person0,"Well, <UNK> provided some guidance on this.
"
Person0,"So, really we're saying it's -- our view hasn't changed on this.
"
Person0,"It's going to continue at the current run rate; the comps become easier.
"
Person0,"We like a lot of what's going on with our business there, but I don't think, <UNK>, we're calling anything additional up or we're calling anything additional down since we spoke with you last.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, just as you think about that guidance for the year, that would imply back-half on our North American office furniture businesses would be flat to up very modestly.
"
Person1,"And that's in line, as <UNK> said, with what we talked about before.
"
Person0,"Say more, please.
"
Person0,"I'm not sure I understand the question.
"
Person0,"Nothing that we would call out.
"
Person1,"So I'll take your corporate question first.
"
Person1,"I would expect, from a full-year basis, corporate expenses to be up slightly.
"
Person1,"You've got some issues on timing.
"
Person1,"We had some big cost reductions in the back-half of last year that will anniversary; some strategic investments; some of the things with our self-insurance programs around medical, and our other insurance programs that move between the quarters.
"
Person1,"And then, finally, you think about incentive-based comp that rolls through there, predominantly around profit-sharing for our members, as our business profitability improves.
"
Person1,"So, we'd expect to see full-year core non-allocated corporate to be up very modestly versus prior-year.
"
Person1,"Your second question was a variable fixed.
"
Person0,"Everything in our business is variable.
"
Person0,"We have no fixed costs.
"
Person0,"So, we don't really separate that out in our thinking.
"
Person0,"We take costs out, and we expect cost to come out and it stays out when it comes out.
"
Person1,"And I'd add -- I'll take a slightly different twist on it -- if you think about structural costs a bit, to <UNK>'s earlier question, what we have not yet to see the real benefit of is important, is this structural -- big structural cost take-outs we talked about beginning of this year, just starting to come into play in the back-half of the year.
"
Person1,"So there remains significant opportunity, as we look out from now through the next three years, to further reduce our structural costs.
"
Person1,"And we called out, back in February again, $35 million to $40 million on a run rate basis.
"
Person0,"And we feel good about that -- that opportunity in front of us.
"
Person0,"That -- we haven't backed off that at all.
"
Person0,"So, as <UNK> said, that's still yet to be executed and still yet to be accounted for as go forward.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So, I'll take a run at that.
"
Person1,"So, clearly, first-half of the year, there was some modest deflation.
"
Person1,"And as we look at -- in the second-half of the year, we'll start to see that flat kind of be flat.
"
Person1,"So we won't see the same benefit.
"
Person1,"But remember, <UNK>, we buy particularly steel and many of our materials on an index basis, so we tend to lag.
"
Person1,"So it's more of a 2017, and really, as you start to get past the second quarter before we start to see any significant impact from a material cost increase.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"That's -- I think you summarized it well, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Well, thank you so much for tuning in.
"
Person0,"We appreciate your interest in HNI, and we look forward to speaking with you more in the future.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
"
