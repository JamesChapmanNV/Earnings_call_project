Person0,"Morning.
"
Person0,"Yes, on the commercial transport aftermarket, if I look at previous cycles around flight hours, this seems to me to be down a lot.
"
Person0,"It seems to me, typically these have started to come back and have caught up.
"
Person0,"I don't know of any change in the underlying use or consumption of the parts, so at some point it's got to pick up.
"
Person0,"Now, do I call the turn exactly right.
"
Person0,"I don't know.
"
Person0,"That's our best judgment as we sit here today.
"
Person0,"As I said, if we're off a little, we think we may have some margin room if you look at it down in EBITDA or EPS.
"
Person0,"I don't have any crystal ball to call the turn exactly.
"
Person0,"And what was your other question about the BizJet.
"
Person0,"Yes, they were down pretty significantly.
"
Person0,"You know, our assumptions are roughly they don't stay like that, they pick up a little bit through the year.
"
Person0,"It seems to us to be an overreaction.
"
Person0,"Now, the commercial Helicopter business is pretty bumpy, as I'm sure you know, and aftermarket OEM, but that's not a lot of our business.
"
Person0,"So I don't see that driving it much, but I would expect the aftermarket from the Business Jets to be a little better, though I have to say, the aftermarket Business Jet bookings weren't great in the quarter.
"
Person0,"That's in the aftermarket.
"
Person0,"The OEM bookings were quite good.
"
Person0,"You have to see a pickup in demand, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"As you know, if you take the numbers this quarter and take the numbers for the year and divide by three, you've got to see a pickup in demand.
"
Person0,"Historically, that's happened after a period like this.
"
Person0,"You've ended up with some pretty high quarters.
"
Person0,"If pickup doesn't happen, we won't meet the number.
"
Person0,"Now that doesn't mean we won't meet our revenue or EPS numbers some other way, but that segment, we would not meet it.
"
Person0,"Well, our assumption going into the year wasn't much growth there.
"
Person0,"Now it wasn't a drop like we saw in the first quarter, so we're kind of the same place as we were going into the year -- that's sort of a flattish market.
"
Person0,"And you know, it's not running at a real high level.
"
Person0,"Every year, everybody thinks it's going to pick up, but it hasn't.
"
Person0,"Now, the underlying take-off and landings aren't great, but they're not drastically down.
"
Person0,"Almost entirely Breeze.
"
Person0,"Almost entirely.
"
Person0,"Anything else was puts and takes.
"
Person0,"If some unit went up, something else went down to offset it.
"
Person0,"It's almost dollar per dollar Breeze.
"
Person1,"I can cover that.
"
Person1,"So the last thing we did was last April or May of 2015.
"
Person1,"I think the coupon on that was about 6.5%.
"
Person1,"Kind of stepping back from the standpoint of the market, the high-yield market has a lot of volatility in there and is primarily in the oil and gas area.
"
Person1,"There is a lot of demand for quality paper that we have.
"
Person1,"We talk to our banks on several occasions and we stay close to them and there would be a lot of interest in us issuing more paper if we had to.
"
Person1,"We don't see the need at this point in time.
"
Person1,"But ultimately, if we were to go to market today in today's conditions, we're probably looking at something in the 7.25%, 7.5% range as a coupon rate.
"
Person0,"That's for step up and leverage.
"
Person0,"Not to replace.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"Just a step up and leverage for new issuance bond -- unsecured bond.
"
Person0,"I think it's just the shipments are so low, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I don't think it's because, it's not that the bookings are so off, it's the shipments are disproportionately down.
"
Person0,"That's the point I was trying to make.
"
Person0,"No, we're not.
"
Person0,"We're not avoiding it.
"
Person0,"It's just, we have the same sort all the time, proprietary aerospace significant aftermarket content.
"
Person0,"What we pay is dependent on what we think of the outlook of it.
"
Person0,"We're neither avoiding nor are we seeking military, disproportionately.
"
Person0,"We're just going to go through it, look at the platforms, look at our forecast, look at our view of it, and price it accordingly.
"
Person1,"Did you say since the end of the quarter.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I don't want to comment on short-term times like that.
"
Person0,"I think we'll wait until the quarter and talk about it when we have the data.
"
Person0,"I don't want to start anecdotally commenting.
"
Person0,"It surely could be.
"
Person0,"But I don't want to hang on anything specific unless I have the data pretty clearly.
"
Person0,"But it's not unusual that we see inventory adjustments at the end of the year.
"
Person0,"People wanting to polish things up.
"
Person0,"It's all over the map.
"
Person0,"It's all over the map for the businesses.
"
Person0,"Some have a catalog they put out once a year, but it's not necessarily on a calendar cycle.
"
Person0,"Some don't -- some don't have a catalog, they price a lot of it on demand.
"
Person0,"So, there's not a one point in time when you can say that they step up.
"
Person0,"I don't think so.
"
Person0,"The real answer is I think it's pretty ratable through the year.
"
Person0,"Maybe a little weighted toward the prices going in in the first half of the year, but then you have to work through the backlog a little bit, so.
"
Person0,"No.
