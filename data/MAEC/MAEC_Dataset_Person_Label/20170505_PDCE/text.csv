Person1,"Yes, Mike, what I was describing specific to the Delaware was that in addition to hedging, we've actually placed or we've actually purchased some firm transport out of the basin, and that's 40 million a day.
"
Person1,"It takes us into the Waha Hub.
"
Person1,"So while not a hedge, it provides us flow assurance.
"
Person1,"So that's something that we think is really important.
"
Person1,"When we think about our general hedging program, we tend to look at our total production, including the Wattenberg, and we're always looking at basis in those sorts of things.
"
Person1,"Right now, obviously, on the gas side, CIG is probably our dominant basis position, so that's what we're taking the closest look at.
"
Person1,"So hopefully that helps.
"
Person2,"Mike.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"From API gravity standpoint, we're not seeing any incremental deducts for the variability in API across our position there.
"
Person2,"There is a slight higher transportation charge per barrels on the West side versus the East side.
"
Person2,"But from all that we see here in front of us today, there is no incremental deducts for API differences.
"
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person2,"So in the Eastern side, we're averaging right in that mid-40s API range.
"
Person2,"As you go towards the Central area, where more sort of the lower 50s to maybe the mid-50s.
"
Person2,"And then on the Western side, we're more than mid-50s to maybe a little bit higher than the mid-50s, but sort in that type of range.
"
Person2,"So Mike, with that test of 12 wells per section in the A that <UNK> described, that compares to our acquisition analysis, our inventory of 8 wells per section in the <UNK>
"
Person2,"So based upon success of that, would then have upward pressure on our inventory, which should be a positive thing for the company.
"
Person2,"As far as other companies test in that tight of spacing, I know that, for example, Cimarex has talked about various tighter down spacings that they are doing.
"
Person2,"In fact, I'd probably start maybe more on the Western side where they have tested 6 and 8 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County and they now plan to do a 12 well per section test in Culberson County called their Seattle Slew test there.
"
Person2,"They're also testing tighter spacing.
"
Person2,"This is Cimarex in Reeves County also in a test called the Wood State.
"
Person2,"So that's another downspacing that they're looking at.
"
Person2,"And then I'd say for the central area, the one we probably look at that's testing this most right now would be Resolute.
"
Person2,"They've got some work that they're doing on various downspacing tests there between the Wolfcamp A itself as well as Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B.
"
Person2,"So there's 2 real examples that are pretty close offsetting this that are testing this tight of spacing.
"
Person2,"So as industry progresses forward, as we get more data, we look to see a lot of additional of testing of this downspacing in offset locations and also as well as ourselves.
"
Person2,"So hopefully, that gives you some insight of what we're looking at.
"
Person2,"For this year, I'll share some thoughts and turn to <UNK>.
"
Person2,"For this year, a lot of our work is focused on HBP and our acreage, and with that, we're doing primarily the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B intervals out there.
"
Person2,"As we continue the HBP, the locations and then get more line of sight on then looking at how we continue to build and grow out the inventory.
"
Person2,"Clearly, we're going to be looking at additional testing and other intervals, both below that and above that, the A and the B that we have talked about.
"
Person2,"So it's something that's on our radar screen.
"
Person2,"That's probably more a year or 2 out that we'll start looking at some of the testing of the other intervals.
"
Person2,"But keep in mind too there's a lot going on in the industry test and additional intervals as well, so we continue to watch them us we're looking at our own programs as well.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, this is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person1,"So our guidance range right now is $3.25 to $3.60 per BOE for the full year, so we continue to -- as you know, we're adding a lot of folks this year, but the good part is, is we continue to see that trend down.
"
Person1,"So I think that the trend is something that we anticipate for the full year.
"
Person1,"Nothing else really remarkable in there.
"
Person1,"Probably just kind of make sure that we trued up for bonuses last year and then we had some deal costs that were in there.
"
Person1,"I think we had just about $11 million of deal costs.
"
Person1,"Is that right.
"
Person1,"So that was probably the biggest difference quarter-to-quarter.
"
Person1,"Yes, that gets us transport to the Waha Hub.
"
Person1,"And then from there, you get access to the Mexico markets.
"
Person1,"You've got good flowback to the East and the shift channel markets and such.
"
Person1,"So yes, just gives us great flexibility.
"
Person1,"Yes, that part is -- that's the index that we're going to be trading against.
"
Person1,"Well, what we can say is that, that's on a FERC-regulated pipe, so it's a tariff rate.
"
Person1,"At this point, it's probably not something that we're going to put out there.
"
Person1,"What I will say is we've captured all the volumes and the commitments in our commitment tables that's in the 10-Q, at least in aggregate.
"
Person0,"Mike, no.
"
Person0,"I think if we're in this -- $45 to $50 range our plan for the year is intact.
"
Person0,"Our permits -- we obviously have the Delaware where we've been very clear on our efforts to hold the acreage.
"
Person0,"Our Wattenberg, if you go back to what <UNK> presented at Analyst Day in some of the economics, even at $40 oil and $2.50 gas are incredibly strong in Wattenberg.
"
Person0,"So I think we've got a good path.
"
Person0,"I think we're not going to overreact to a market that corrects, hopefully, short term.
"
Person0,"If our internal outlooks shifted to where we saw a longer term price correction, I think that will be something where we'll start looking at '18 and '19 and where we take the company.
"
Person0,"But I think we've got a good plan this year, and you can expect us to grow in line with what we're guiding.
"
Person0,"Yes, thank you, Kevin, and thank you, everybody, and all the Mikes out there.
"
Person0,"And we appreciate the ongoing support and expect more to come as we go through the year.
"
