Person0,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Sure thing, <UNK>, and I think you've already called several of them.
"
Person1,"If I think about overall consumer banking and private wealth, there's pluses and minuses in there.
"
Person1,"With the effect of the posting order, that will be a little bit of a negative.
"
Person1,"But as we continue to bring in more clients into our private wealth business, and move them into an asset management model, they're very good long-term fees that I think are going to be generated, as we help that set of clients.
"
Person1,"Mortgage overall, as you know, seasonally Q2 and Q3 are the best seasons for mortgage.
"
Person1,"Q4 and Q1 are typically slower.
"
Person1,"So as we move into Q4, mortgage fees probably come off.
"
Person1,"But looking out over the course of the next year or two, we've built a terrific mortgage business, and we're gaining market share.
"
Person1,"And as we do that, I feel good about where our mortgage business is going overall.
"
Person1,"Within the wholesale banking business, we've already talked a fair bit about the growth in capital markets, about our business model that brings big bank capabilities and expertise to our core commercial client base.
"
Person1,"And as we continue to work more with that client base, I think you're going to see fees and wholesale banking grow, as we gain market share there.
"
Person1,"So if I try to put all of those things together over time, <UNK>, the net fees for us even excluding Pillar, I think are going to be going up over time.
"
Person1,"Adding Pillar to that is only a positive.
"
Person1,"And as I said earlier about Pillar specifically, I think in 2017, we'll see about $90 million of fee revenue from Pillar.
"
Person1,"Well, you're right, first quarter for us is always going to be higher.
"
Person1,"That's just the way it works in our industry.
"
Person1,"And so, I do expect that for that quarter, in and of itself we'll have -- if you look at one line item being expenses, it will be higher than you would see otherwise.
"
Person1,"But we don't really think about one quarter in and of itself, in the context of running the overall business.
"
Person1,"Our commitment has been, we're going to continue to make this business more efficient over time.
"
Person1,"We've done that now for five years in a row.
"
Person1,"And right now, looking out into 2017, I fully expect that our 2017 efficiency ratio is going to look the same or better than 2016 does.
"
Person1,"And on a full year basis, across the entire income statement, that's what we try to do.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, that is indeed right about the right delta, and there's not one big thing in there.
"
Person0,"We're talking about several small items, none of which in and of themselves, were worth calling out.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, again, you've got it exactly right.
"
Person1,"There's lots of things going on in there, some positive, some negative.
"
Person1,"And while if I look at NIM, I can see NIM declining a couple basis points in Q4.
"
Person1,"When I look at NII for all of those reasons, including the growth in securities, I do think that NII, we can continue to increase from the levels you saw in Q3 this year.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, your previous training is causing you to look into this with a lot of detail, and again, you're exactly right.
"
Person0,"If you think about how FTP works over time, the effect of FTP changes can be exaggerated at turns in rates.
"
Person0,"So when rates are moving up, and they turn and go down, you kind of have an exaggerated FTP effect for a year.
"
Person0,"When rates have been going down, and they kind of turn, and start to go up, you see that same effect.
"
Person0,"And in our case for 2016, you're seeing exactly some of that in FTP for 2016.
"
Person0,"I would expect some of that to dissipate, as we start to get a trend in rates, with rates going up over time.
