Person,Sentence
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I mean, with respect to this steam coal, I mean, the coal that we handle is the cleanest, lowest ash, highest BTU stuff that gets -- it's the last -- literally the last coal burning on earth.
"
Person1,"So a good chunk of what we sell actually doesn't even go to China, it's consumed in Japan and South Korea and Taiwan.
"
Person1,"It's very high-grade stuff from first and second quartile-type mines, and so -- and even to the extent that there are restrictions on coal consumption within China, the quality of coal that we're handling there is going to get -- it's going to be blended into the mix.
"
Person1,"It's not a relevant competitor for things like lower-grade Indonesian coal and the like.
"
Person1,"So this is -- so the answer -- the immediate answer is the coal business is very strong and stable.
"
Person1,"What's the other part of the question.
"
Person2,"Queensland.
"
Person1,"Yes, I mean, with respect to other geographies, there's always opportunity in different parts of Australia for new contracts that we are regularly bidding on and if customers want us in a given geography, we go.
"
Person1,"And so we've got open dialogues in several markets.
"
Person2,"Well, you have 2 questions there.
"
Person2,"Let me turn the first part of your question around rate renewals to <UNK> and then I'll hit your second part of the question.
"
Person2,"Yes, and <UNK>, with respect to the mix issue, I would just turn it over to <UNK> so I can look at my underlying analysis.
"
Person2,"And the mix headwinds we saw in Q1 are really the ones that we expect for the full year.
"
Person2,"It's largely ag and coal.
"
Person1,"Yes, that one, in a competitive market, I can't answer.
"
Person1,"That gives a -- that's a step too far given that we compete for that business.
"
Person1,"Well, you've got 9 coal sets in operation today.
"
Person1,"You've heard us say we're adding 2 more, one that's coming in June, the other that's coming in at the end of the year.
"
Person1,"In both instances, we're using excess -- those are only wagons because we're using excess high horsepower locomotives from South Australia that used to serve one of the mines that's no longer shipping.
"
Person1,"And so this is the last of our excess locomotive capacity in Australia that we're deploying there.
"
Person1,"And so you've got 2 incremental -- you have 2 incremental train sets for spot moves.
"
Person1,"Recall that there are forward -- there's forward opportunity with our core contract with Glencore where those, if they weren't in spot service, they would be cascaded into permanently contracted status within 2 years, by the way.
"
Person1,"And so this is -- these will be making money between here and there.
"
Person1,"I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.
"
Person1,"Say it again.
"
Person1,"Yes, I do think that number would be misleading because it's embedded in specific contract terms that were of a multibillion-dollar deal.
"
Person1,"Yes, you wouldn't -- that wouldn't put you on the right path.
"
Person1,"You can certainly assume that you're going to earn your cost of capital on that under some very comfortable assumptions or you wouldn't be doing it.
"
Person1,"And you can certainly assume that one prices spot moves at a premium to contracted moves because there's implicitly more risk to it.
"
Person1,"But I think I would leave it at that.
"
Person1,"The answer is both.
"
Person1,"The answer is that we wouldn't be doing it if we didn't think it was a good use of our capital on -- I mean it's -- if you do the math, it's, obviously, highly book accretive.
"
Person1,"But that's not the primary driver.
"
Person1,"We look at free cash flow generation of the business and what we think it's worth, and we think this is a wise way to deploy capital.
"
Person1,"I wouldn't say necessarily -- there are certainly acquisitions that -- certain types of acquisitions that we could fold in, perhaps at an even more economically attractive basis than buying our own shares.
"
Person1,"And so you've got to keep the dry powder available to do those and we're certainly looking at those as well.
"
Person1,"But given how much debt we've paid down, we're very comfortable that we can look at doing both over time, and that's what we ramped up here through April.
"
Person2,"Operator, we're out of time so please review the replay instructions.
"
Person2,"And thank you, very much for joining us on this call.
"
