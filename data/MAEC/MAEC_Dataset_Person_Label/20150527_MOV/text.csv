Person2,"I think we are looking at for it to be somewhat neutral overall to the Company's bottom line this year and so we will make investments against the category.
"
Person2,"And we believe that longer term it will have a definite -- presents a definite opportunity for the Company.
"
Person2,"You're getting a tremendous amount of interest brought into the category overall and people who may have been -- consumers who may have been getting out of the watch market are now developing an interest in the watch category.
"
Person2,"And I think that's an overall positive for the category, especially long-term.
"
Person2,"I would think you're looking at end of third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"We expect to launch our first wearable into the Movado brand before the holiday season.
"
Person2,"So -- and that would be our expectation right now.
"
Person2,"I think it's a little early for us to probably say that publicly.
"
Person2,"I would think we'll have more information in that later in the year and as we publicly announce what we're doing in that segment.
"
Person0,"So the UK is one of the markets where we are seeing traction.
"
Person0,"Movado is doing well.
"
Person0,"HUGO BOSS, as I mentioned, is really a great success story.
"
Person0,"Other places in Europe where we're starting to see some sparks of business building, which we're very happy, for example, Spain.
"
Person0,"Spain has been a market that for a very long time has been a difficult one.
"
Person0,"We're starting to see some very strong results on some of our licensed brands in Spain.
"
Person0,"Germany continues to do well and we see accelerated growth on a couple of our licensed brands, as well as some of our Ebel business in Germany, we're seeing very strong sell-through from our new Wave introduction.
"
Person0,"And it's very interesting because there's been a shift in the traveling corridors of Chinese consumers.
"
Person0,"We saw the decline here in the US.
"
Person0,"We're seeing a pickup in Europe.
"
Person0,"And also if you think about the Middle East region, we're seeing a pickup in Middle Eastern consumers also in Europe.
"
Person0,"We're seeing that in Switzerland and particularly in Germany.
"
Person0,"So one of the things we're being very mindful is how do we capture this traveling consumer with a product that is relevant to them in the locations that they are traveling.
"
Person0,"So we.
"
Person0,"ve been able to make some shifts in that regard and I think we're seeing the results.
"
Person0,"For us, the most immediate opportunity is we have a lot of runway ahead of our current portfolio.
"
Person0,"And that is our number-one priority.
"
Person0,"These are part of our Company and we have an obligation to fully exploit these powerful licensed brands around the globe.
"
Person0,"So that's our number-one priority at this point.
"
Person2,"Sure you haven't seen that much of a fluctuation in the Swiss franc.
"
Person2,"It's over year on year.
"
Person2,"And if you look at it, I think, Sally, it's 200 basis points in the quarter of gross margin fluctuation is just currency.
"
Person2,"And you have to remember that we implemented most of our price increases very late in the quarter, so they had virtually no impact on the first quarter.
"
Person2,"And I think the second and third quarter will be more indicative of our year-end gross margins.
"
Person2,"And we do, as I said in my comments, expect them to improve, predominately due to our price increases.
"
Person2,"We had not taken price increases in a number of years.
"
Person2,"And I think we said that in our last conference call, so this is the first time we've taken a significant price -- really a price increase at all, in five, six years.
"
Person2,"We had made a strategic decision, prior to that, to absorb cost increases.
"
Person2,"And due to the extreme volatility of currency in the fourth quarter of last year, decided that strategically the best thing for the Company was to implement a price increase and we believe it was the right decision.
"
Person0,"We will see the benefit of that in the second half of the year.
"
Person0,"Well, as we discussed in our previous call, we were very, very mindful and strategic on how we implemented these increases.
"
Person0,"And one of the key things was we did not vacate key price points that are important gates for consumers.
"
Person0,"So prices like $495, $995.
"
Person0,"These price points we protected.
"
Person0,"What is very interesting is, in our research, pricing is not the number-one driver of the decision for a watch.
"
Person0,"Actually design and style, brand, quality, these are the number -- the more important attributes in making a decision for a watch purchase.
"
Person0,"And these are areas where we feel very strong with all our brands in our watch offerings.
"
Person0,"So obviously there is a risk, but we believe the benefits are greater and some of the things we asked around the globe -- many consumers don't remember how much they paid for a watch or if you ask them how much it is, they may actually think the price is higher.
"
Person0,"So this is a very -- it's not an exact science.
"
Person0,"And I think, again, the strong brand, strong quality, strong design -- those are the key motivators for the purchase.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"I'd like to thank all of you for participating with us today and wish you all an excellent summer.
"
Person2,"Again, thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you after our next quarter's earnings.
"
