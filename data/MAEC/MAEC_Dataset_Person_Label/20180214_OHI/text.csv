Person0,"The insurance proceeds, is that in the guidance.
"
Person0,"And the timing, would that be second half.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"when we thought about it, <UNK>, the cash flow will come in likely as a rebuild.
"
Person0,"So we'll be able to redeploy it, but it's going to take a period of time.
"
Person0,"It is booked as income because we had to take the impairment, but that's not in the numbers.
"
Person0,"I would exclude that from the AFFO, just as I excluded the impairment related to it.
"
Person2,"Just to follow up on <UNK>'s question, I believe, on the Genesis loan.
"
Person2,"So what's assumed there in terms of accruing for interest income on that $48 million loan.
"
Person2,"And then there was like a temporary forgiveness to them.
"
Person2,"And if you could just give us a sense of kind of what -- how that restructuring for Genesis is playing out when you expect interest to continue to repay it again.
"
Person0,"So we continue to accrue the interest on that loan, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That's our one significant concession and direct level workout that's really driven by rather 2 big landlords, Welltower and Sabra.
"
Person0,"Just to give you a little bit of color on that loan, that loan is fully collateralized, very sufficiently collateralized, including the accrued interest.
"
Person0,"So we feel very comfortable about that loan and any scenario.
"
Person0,"In terms of where Genesis is headed, we'll leave that to them.
"
Person0,"But the pieces, we know we feel good about their progress.
"
Person2,"So when did they start paying cash again on the loan.
"
Person2,"What's your expectation.
"
Person2,"What's in the guidance, I guess.
"
Person0,"So the forbearance as of February.
"
Person0,"So we don't expect that to come back in <UNK>h unless there are some -- there's no other -- there's been no other discussion related to it, but it would be -- the expectation would be <UNK>h unless we have some change between now and then.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"And then just on your demographic comment, what's the average entry age of a skilled nursing customer.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"It's a very interesting, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"The utilization rates for skilled, if you look at each age from 65 to 75, the curve is very gradual.
"
Person0,"And it moves up, obviously, and then it's the 75- to 76-year-old age group and up each -- by each year.
"
Person0,"It starts to increase very significantly, as you would expect, all the way in through the 80s and 90s.
"
Person0,"It increases each year of age.
"
Person0,"So if we, call it, 76 years old as an [interesting] point where you start to accelerate utilization and you think about birth rates beginning to increase in 1940.
"
Person0,"So a couple of years ago, we started to see those 1940-year-olds first hit 76, now 77 and 78 years old.
"
Person0,"And they're progressing up and we have a lot behind them from a natality perspective from 1940 on.
"
Person0,"And then '45, obviously it explodes.
"
Person0,"But from '40 on, you have birth rates going up, and that's part of the driver in this demographic and part of the detailed analysis that <UNK> <UNK> and Matthew Gourmand will work on to provide high-level information to our investors.
"
Person2,"So the average age of a skilled nursing patient is in the mid-70s.
"
Person2,"So 10 -- more or less 10 years younger than seniors' housing.
"
Person2,"Is that what you guys are seeing.
"
Person0,"If you look at -- and we'll provide the utilization curve that we've developed as part of our information on -- at least on a national basis, we'll provide it.
"
Person0,"The mid-70s utilization rates, that's where you really start to see it pick up in a meaningful way.
"
Person0,"So I hesitate to say an average, but because it weighs even more heavily as you get out on the curve.
"
Person0,"But I think it's fair to think about it as mid-70s and beyond driving a bulk of admissions into our facilities.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much for joining our call today.
"
Person0,"We'll be available for any follow-up that anyone may have.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
