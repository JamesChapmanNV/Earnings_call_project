Person2,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I would say you're correct in concluding that utility and ESS are going to provide the lion's share of the sales growth.
"
Person2,"And I think the indication is that irrigation is going to be on the whole similar to last year.
"
Person2,"And then in coatings, we believe we'll get some growth, plus on top of that we'll have a full-year impact of the Texas facility which started up late last year and didn't really contribute much to the top line.
"
Person2,"And then Energy and Mining would be relatively flat compared to what we saw in 2016.
"
Person2,"So I think as far as -- there really isn't -- we haven't provided a specific breakout as far as pricings.
"
Person2,"There's certainly some pricing baked into that 5% sales growth, but, and it varies a little bit by segment.
"
Person2,"But I'd say the majority of it is expected to be volume-related revenue growth.
"
Person2,"Yes, I would say more or less that would be the case.
"
Person2,"If you look at overall expected economic growth in the US, that should rise on the whole, coatings sales.
"
Person2,"It depends a little about an individual sector's, but I think that's a fair assumption.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we haven't gotten into that level of detail as far as profitability by segment.
"
Person2,"But certainly, if you think about what <UNK>'s comments were regarding lead times and utility in the pipeline and the orders and so forth, we're expecting to continue and the operational [objectives] as well to continue to grow on the utility side of it.
"
Person2,"Right.
"
Person2,"Yes, you are right.
"
Person2,"I mean one of the things we -- a couple things we saw particularly in the back end of the year after Brexit was a pretty significant decrease in the discount rates, the AA corporate-bond rates which really drives much of pension valuation.
"
Person2,"Because as those rates go down, all the future payments end up being amounting to more money because they're discounted at lower rates.
"
Person2,"So you saw we had an increase in our pension liability, but it's important to understand that this plan is a dormant plan.
"
Person2,"So all of the members of the plan are either retirees that are drawing a pension today or they're deferred members, so there's no actives in there.
"
Person2,"So in that sense, it's got a little different risk profile to it as well as time goes on.
"
Person2,"We'll see some valuation bounce around with respect to -- just because of how discount rates work, but the asset portfolio did quite well in 2016 and it helped to mitigate some of the effects of the discount rate effect.
"
Person2,"But I think we're -- we work closely with the pension trustee board and it's just something we have to manage over time and we feel over the long term it won't be a big material impact to us as this all unwinds, but it's a pretty volatile environment right now.
"
Person1,"I would say <UNK>, that it's relatively small related to that as well.
"
Person1,"Where we're going to continue to be opportunistic, where we can, so we're not building in a lot of activity on share repurchase for 2017, but that remains to be seen depending on what happens with the market.
"
