Person,Sentence
Person1,"Morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Good, how are you.
"
Person1,"Yes, so on the commercial real estate side, I would say that there is some less competition, and pricing I think has stabilized and perhaps increased some.
"
Person1,"Threshold, on the thresholds we're fine, and the first part of your question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, so as we look at our backlog, we've been experiencing an opportunity from market disruption.
"
Person1,"And as we look at our backlog going into the fourth quarter, I think the percent of our backlog remains about the same when we look at what's coming from market disruption.
"
Person1,"So we believe it will continue at least in the short term.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I would say it's both.
"
Person1,"So we continue to make improvements, and we're certainly subject to the schedules that are set by the regulators.
"
Person1,"Morning, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Hey, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"So yes, you're right about the actual shift in the mix, but the one thing we are seeing whether it's C&I or CRE is a continued shift away from fixed into the floating.
"
Person2,"So that trend probably isn't affected by the mix shift.
"
Person2,"Certainly from a resi perspective, the popularity of the jumbo product is very much 15-year fixed.
"
Person2,"But as a percentage of total, it hasn't had a huge impact on originations because those remain at historically low levels as well.
"
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person2,"So we've got of the total loan book about 80% is non-fixed, of that $10 billion or so, about 40% is LIBOR the rest being prime, $4 billion.
"
Person2,"And we've got about $2.5 billion of exposure within that $4 billion to LIBOR, either on the swap curve or the one and two month.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"It wasn't -- it was not a meaningful impact though on the quarter on our NII.
"
Person2,"It is for a couple of quarters.
"
Person2,"We'll see this kind of run rate, so we were at, call it, $3.2 million a quarter overall pretty steadily historically and that's dropped down to about $1.9 million.
"
Person2,"That will continue for the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but then it will tick back up again.
"
Person2,"We'll get back about 60% of that savings because Fulton Bank is over $10 billion.
"
Person2,"So we really just benefited from Fulton Bank, because it went over $10 billion early this year.
"
Person2,"But you have a four-quarter average before you get to the large bank premium schedule.
"
Person2,"So it will be the same run rate for the next two quarters, then it will gradually increase.
"
Person2,"Once we consolidate all the banks, which over time, we will return that to the approximately the run rate that we've been experiencing at around $3.2 million a quarter.
"
Person2,"Well, the charter consolidation will begin as soon as we can, and we'll do one bank at a time.
"
Person2,"So if when we're allowed and a strategic acquisition develops, we can delay the consolidation.
"
Person2,"But I would anticipate that we will begin it immediately or as quickly as we can and then complete it.
"
Person2,"If a strategic acquisition doesn't develop, or if it does we can delay.
"
Person1,"Morning <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Hey, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"So I'll take those in reverse order.
"
Person2,"So the DP reduction was meaningful this quarter, and it will probably be choppy and volatile certainly based on volume.
"
Person2,"But these are largely major technology contracts that don't come due every year, every quarter.
"
Person2,"We're working hard to renegotiate these for more favorable terms, so we're able to benefit from that this quarter.
"
Person2,"But that doesn't necessarily mean that next quarter or the quarter after we won't renegotiate one that's been in place for ten years, and have a higher rate on that.
"
Person2,"So we're going to work hard to sustain the level that we've dropped to, but I just wanted to highlight that.
"
Person2,"But it's not necessarily as simple as yes, it's sustainable.
"
Person2,"On the professional services, that can be pretty volatile quarter to quarter.
"
Person2,"But I guess I'd tell you that if you look at the run rate that we've seen year to date or the run rate for the last year full year, I think that's maybe around $2 million, $2.1 million a quarter, then that would be a good run rate to use.
"
Person2,"We're not going to try to give guidance on intra-quarter volatility based on timing and billings.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"Hey, Matt, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"So just general rule of thumb, we'd benefit by about $6 million of pre-tax NII on a full-year run rate basis for every 25 basis points.
"
Person1,"So, Matt, the loan growth primarily came in our Pennsylvania and Maryland markets, and I don't have the specific ROAs for the banks in front of me.
"
Person1,"New Jersey would be below average, yes.
"
Person1,"Well specifically in <UNK>adelphia we'd be close to zero, and we'd anticipate or move into <UNK>adelphia to be an area that will provide growth for us.
"
Person1,"So currently we have just the one person that we hired who is in the market to hire additional lenders, and we now have two mortgage originators in <UNK>adelphia.
"
Person1,"Thank you all for joining us today.
"
Person1,"We hope you'll be able to be with us when we discuss fourth-quarter results in January.
"
