Person1,"No, the ERM will continue.
"
Person1,"It is impacted, as <UNK> mentioned, we expect normal hydro, and then it's also impacted by natural gas prices.
"
Person1,"The same impacts that we have every year, we have that same variability.
"
Person1,"It won't change until we file another general rate case, or if the commission in their order petition, responding to the petition for rehearing or reconsideration, updates our power supply costs.
"
Person1,"So otherwise we will have that normal variability until the next rate case, which would reset our power supply costs.
"
Person1,"Correct.
"
Person0,"If you recall it, <UNK>, we tried to do that back in 2006 and filed a power cost adjustment rate case, and the commission rejected that.
"
Person0,"So we do not have that mechanism in our opportunity, but Puget Sound Energy does.
"
Person0,"So we tried it and it was rejected, so we have to file a general rate case to reset power supply.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"It's primarily oil prices really.
"
Person2,"When we purchased the company in July of 2014, oil prices were well over $100 a barrel, and they're half that now.
"
Person2,"So that certainly created a bit more of a challenging situation with regard to economics.
"
Person2,"They -- then there's customer conversion costs, and that plays into it, and access to low-cost financing and some other things.
"
Person2,"But I would say the primary driver is just the cost of oil being what it is.
"
Person2,"But we're going to continue.
"
Person2,"We did -- we spent a lot of time looking at it and explored it, did a lot of really good, detailed work.
"
Person2,"So we will continue, as <UNK> said.
"
Person2,"We will continue to monitor the situation.
"
Person2,"If things change, we'll reassess.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
