Person2,"So basically, in all the -- we have very limited distribution for <UNK>ge.
"
Person2,"We are launching it very similar to how we launched Bold about four years ago.
"
Person2,"And at every retailer that we are operating in, we are obtaining incremental space for <UNK>ge.
"
Person2,"It is -- the whole collection today is 14 SKUs.
"
Person2,"It will grow.
"
Person2,"But we are very pleased with the initial results and have gotten great reviews from our retail partners; the press; and, even very early on, also from consumers.
"
Person2,"So we are pleased with that.
"
Person2,"I think it is still too volatile an environment.
"
Person2,"What we have seen is -- and we've been talking about this, as you mentioned, for quite a while now -- we have been working with our retail partners, and they've been great partners to us.
"
Person2,"In some cases, we are where we need to be; other cases, given slow retail that they faced in Q3, they are making other adjustments.
"
Person2,"So this is a work in progress.
"
Person2,"And obviously Q4 -- sig sales for all of us.
"
Person2,"This will affect what the number ends up being.
"
Person2,"But like we have said before, we are very confident in our innovation pipeline.
"
Person2,"Our product offering for this holiday season is really very strong -- not just because we are saying it, but our retail partners are also commenting on the strength of our product offering across our portfolio.
"
Person2,"And we believe that innovation and beautiful product will attract consumers to purchase.
"
Person2,"That is the thesis behind our success, and that is something we are focusing on for great execution in the fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"So in Europe it's mostly our licensed brands that are having great performance.
"
Person2,"And obviously, it is our bigger brands that are driving it.
"
Person2,"Hugo Boss has had spectacular results in Europe, and we are particularly pleased because this is happening in big markets.
"
Person2,"So the UK, France, and Germany, as I mentioned, are having spectacular results.
"
Person2,"We are also seeing this on Tommy Hilfiger.
"
Person2,"And there is different pockets growth for the rest of the brands.
"
Person2,"But overall, we are very happy.
"
Person2,"We are also very pleased with the results of the Movado brand in the UK, which is one of our focus markets -- still very small, but the sellthrough results have really accelerated.
"
Person2,"So we are very pleased with that.
"
Person2,"Well, we don't operate in a promotional environment, but obviously our retailers do.
"
Person2,"It's been quite promotional over the last several holiday seasons.
"
Person2,"I think there is possibilities you will see a scaling back of that in the future.
"
Person2,"I don't think you'll see that this holiday season.
"
Person2,"You will see a very strong newspaper campaign as well as a digital campaign on Movado Motion.
"
Person2,"In fact, this weekend there was a full-page ad in the New York Times.
"
Person2,"There is a full-page ad today in the New York Post on Movado Museum's forward motion.
"
Person2,"And most of that will be in newspaper and digital this fall.
"
Person0,"So we can't give you the breakdown.
"
Person0,"But what I will tell you is that our like-for-like growth was there for most of our brands, and certainly for the Movado brand, which is our flagship.
"
Person2,"But our performance basically in the US -- and I will add to <UNK>'s point -- is 100% in existing stores.
"
Person2,"We really did not open up any new distribution this fall.
"
Person2,"You know, might be selected few doors for certain products, but not any large distribution growth.
"
Person2,"I think the opportunity now comes really more in newness, where you focus on making sure that you are able to protect your gross margins versus price increases.
"
Person2,"There may be some opportunities in Europe down the road, but it's not built into our plans right now.
"
Person0,"I just want to build on that.
"
Person0,"We are very committed to expanding gross margin; and there are other initiatives, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of managing other levers of gross margin in terms of product mix, channel mix.
"
Person0,"And we have this thing internally called the magic quadrant, where we are focusing on these categories and these products.
"
Person0,"And the entire organization has embraced this, and we are going to continue to see results coming from these initiatives -- along with, of course, supply chain improvements to this.
"
Person2,"The reality is we are fortunate to have -- I will speak to Movado first.
"
Person2,"This is a very powerful brand, and many of our retailers benefit by having Movado in their stores.
"
Person2,"So I think they understand this very well, and they have been supportive along those lines.
"
Person2,"Of course, there are -- some of them have thought about connected technology and made initial forays into creating either new sections or awarding more inventory there.
"
Person2,"And we will see what the result is.
"
Person2,"For the time being, they have been supportive of our connected technology initiatives.
"
Person2,"And like I said my prepared remarks, we are very confident that what we are offering is what consumers want for the Movado brand.
"
Person2,"So we will see at the end of the quarter how we perform.
"
Person2,"But we are very confident, both in the design of the watch; the functionality; and the app is really fabulous.
"
Person2,"So we are very confident.
"
Person2,"I will take the first part of that, and then I will hand -- I will turn the currency part over to <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I think we are excited, as <UNK> mentioned, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about the innovation pipeline that we have introduced in Q4 for this holiday season.
"
Person2,"And both the connected initiatives as well as major product introductions like <UNK>ge.
"
Person2,"But, also, new products and innovation across all of our brands -- things like a men's assortment in our Coach brands that is performing very well.
"
Person2,"So I think there's a -- it's really driven by newness and marketing initiatives across our brand portfolio.
"
Person2,"And I will turn the currency part over to <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, so <UNK>, just a quick one on the currency.
"
Person1,"Obviously we don't guide to a constant currency number.
"
Person1,"We guide to an as-reported number.
"
Person1,"But this year to date, we've had $20 million already on our top line related to currency.
"
Person1,"And if you recall, last year during the fourth quarter is really when we had the big change in currency.
"
Person1,"So we will continue to have a few months where there is definitely a difference between this year and last, and take it through the end of the year -- obviously, 2 1/2 months of three being somewhat different on our constant currency comparison.
"
Person1,"But even on an as-reported basis, you could do the math with your models, and you will see that there will be -- we are counting on some growth, based on the initiatives that we have talked about the fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"You will find that today in major department stores as well, and on their website as well as in major chain jewelers and fine jewelry independents.
"
Person2,"So it will be available in-store as well as online.
"
Person2,"We are rolling it out.
"
Person2,"We are doing a lot of training in-store.
"
Person2,"We have special visuals for the product that highlight the technology and highlight the app on the phone that is available for Android and iOS.
"
Person2,"And it is a well-tested app, so we are really excited about that.
"
Person1,"I will address a few things, and then I will see if anyone else wants to jump in, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"So, obviously, we are talking just about fiscal 2016 at this moment.
"
Person1,"We haven't gone out with anything further going into next fiscal year and beyond.
"
Person1,"We've had the benefit this year in SG&A, where currency has taken our numbers down.
"
Person1,"So we have continued to invest this year in people, in marketing, in all the things that we need to do to support the brand.
"
Person1,"And this year, we have performance-based compensation in our number, where a year ago we didn't.
"
Person1,"So we are very happy with the way that we invest -- although, as you know, we are very good here at running things lean and really watching how we spend our money.
"
Person1,"So it's a combination of the two.
"
Person1,"But we are not giving anything up.
"
Person1,"We are definitely supporting what we need to as far as the growth and the health of this business.
"
Person1,"The Q will be out later today, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"A lot of that detail will be in there.
"
Person1,"And if you have any further questions after that, I am sure we can help you.
"
Person2,"I would like to thank all of you for participating today on our call.
"
Person2,"I wish everybody a fabulous Thanksgiving and a great holiday season.
"
Person2,"Thank you again for being with us.
"
