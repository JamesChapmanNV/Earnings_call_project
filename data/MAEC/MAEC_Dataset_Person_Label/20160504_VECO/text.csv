Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Well, I hope they're right.
"
Person1,"And I think that there are larger drives being made with more heads and more disks going into the enterprise and cloud type opportunities, so I think that is one of the positive trends there.
"
Person1,"There's also a continuing need to evolve some of the technologies, get more performance out of the drives, and so we see the big--the opportunity for us is helping to move the technology forward as well as provide quite a few different types of services for the industry that really improve their productivity and improve their profitability.
"
Person1,"Should we get back to a point where we actually see some capacity growth, that will be great.
"
Person1,"But our strategy for this business has been to continue to serve the data storage business, but to take the unique technologies we have in that area and leverage them into other markets that do have a lot of growth.
"
Person1,"And I think one of the examples I gave of that early--earlier--was taking magnetic ion beam etch capability and taking it into the front end magnetic memory market.
"
Person1,"We think that will give us some extra growth over the long term, as well as taking it into the MEMS and RF areas, which we've done.
"
Person1,"So we don't think of that--our business--as a data storage business any more.
"
Person1,"We think of it as an ion beam etch and deposition business that happens to serve the data storage market.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"And with that, we will wrap up.
"
Person1,"Thank you all for joining us tonight.
