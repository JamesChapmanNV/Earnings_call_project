Person,Sentence
Person0,"I think that, to start with your first question, I think it's a combination of operating leverages and improved volumes and operating efficiencies on the variable side.
"
Person0,"So it's a combination of both of them.
"
Person0,"There is a lot of volume leverage in that, but it's a combination of the two.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"And then, <UNK> -- I think one of the things, timing of stripping, <UNK>, I would say maybe had some benefit of it that will -- that's always comes in fits and starts, but it's not a whole lot.
"
Person1,"And, <UNK>, for the full-year outlook, we will see -- we are very focused, as <UNK> mentioned, on continuing to drive these operating efficiencies to control what we can control, to use <UNK>'s words, and to leverage our cost of sales where we can.
"
Person1,"We will see how we come out.
"
Person1,"There are a lot of moving pieces in a business like ours, but it's something we're very, very focused on.
"
Person0,"First of all, I wish we were running two shifts everywhere.
"
Person0,"I'm an old operating guy, and life is good if that happens.
"
Person0,"But it's on a market-by-market, plant-by-plant basis.
"
Person0,"So, for example, you go to Texas, you've got plants that are running two shifts already.
"
Person0,"You go to some markets in some of our Atlanta operations, they are not even running a full shift.
"
Person0,"So it's such a local business and that is market by market, so there's not a broad-based statement.
"
Person0,"But overall, we will do that a little bit at a time, but we are nowhere close in most markets to adding shifts.
"
Person0,"It's really adding hours or even adding a full shift on a full plant.
"
Person0,"But we would love to have those problems.
"
Person1,"We also, <UNK>, back to <UNK>'s point, we are probably getting -- with the breadth of the recovery, we're probably getting to a point where we have enough volume in more of our key facilities to begin to realize a little more operating leverage.
"
Person1,"Leverage of fixed costs.
"
Person1,"Now we're a long ways away -- and, <UNK>, we discussed it, from any kind of operating sweet spot and we are even further away from production capacity.
"
Person1,"But one of the benefits to us of getting more volume in more places is that it helps on the fixed-cost leverage.
"
Person1,"I'd break it into two pieces for you.
"
Person1,"I think about of the $275 million of operating and maintenance CapEx, for many of those investments we begin to see operating efficiencies pretty darn quick if we are improving or right-sizing mobile equipment fleet, if we're replacing screens or otherwise improving our production processes at a plant level.
"
Person1,"We try and work those as best we can to have pretty quick return periods on those investments.
"
Person1,"For the $125 million for the course of the year that we may spend on growth related PP&E, it's really going to depend on the nature of the investment.
"
Person1,"These aren't long-term payoff things, these aren't things where you invest one year and you get the benefit 10 years down the road.
"
Person1,"But it's highly variable, whether it's a new railyard or incremental reserve capacity at a quarry or whether it's a new ship.
"
Person1,"It's hard to say on the growth capital.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company and we look forward to speaking to you throughout the quarter.
"
