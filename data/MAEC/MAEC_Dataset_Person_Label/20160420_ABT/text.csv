Person1,"Yes, again I don't feel unreasonably constrained at all.
"
Person1,"I think that we're always conscious of capital allocation, we're always conscious of return, we're always conscious of where our debt is and what our debt rating is and so forth.
"
Person1,"We want to be all in the right balance here, but for the things that I think would be on my radar screen I think we're in good shape here.
"
Person0,"Operator, we'll take one more question.
"
Person1,"Well on the last part it hasn't yet but it could.
"
Person1,"And we're prepared for that if it does.
"
Person1,"So that remains.
"
Person1,"It's still working its way through the Indian courts.
"
Person1,"But maybe <UNK> has got more detail on that right now than I do but it hasn't yet.
"
Person0,"Yes, and I would also add just on the quarter there is some timing, to Mile's point there is always some tender timing in various countries.
"
Person0,"If you take the first quarter and the second quarter you're looking at a first half of the year that will be a high single-digit operational growth for EPD.
"
Person0,"And that's strong growth.
"
Person1,"It's kind of too early to tell.
"
Person1,"I think you kind of hope so but to call it sustainable I'd like to see some more data and I'd like to see a little more time.
"
Person1,"Because generally speaking in the Nutrition business in the United States share might blip up and down a little bit but over time remains relatively static.
"
Person1,"It's pretty difficult to move share sustainably and meaningfully over time in the US.
"
Person1,"And your ability to grow the adult Nutrition business is to grow the market for the most part.
"
Person1,"And as you know we are the leader in that market.
"
Person1,"And pediatric, share may move a couple of points here and there but it always seems to snap back to wherever its median point was.
"
Person1,"So we're always pushing on share gain and about the time you think you've gotten somewhere with it something happens, competitive response or whatever, it moves back the other way.
"
Person1,"So I think to call current momentum sustainable I think I'd say let me see another quarter.
"
