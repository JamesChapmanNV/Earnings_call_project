Person1,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"You know, that's a great question, <UNK>, I'm not sure I have a good answer for you but I can assure you that we're not breaking contracts.
"
Person1,"So to the extent that we're reducing our export sales it's in situations that are more consistent with a quarterly or monthly kind of arrangement versus a long-term arrangement.
"
Person1,"That's probably just our normal things and we probably shouldn't astric that.
"
Person2,"We don't have any big projects going on in Longview.
"
Person2,"The challenge with Longview being a little more this year is both recovery furnaces on an 18 month cycle now and they are both hitting in this year so that'll be a little bit more.
"
Person0,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"The $60 million to $70 million is just containerboard and corrugated.
"
Person1,"Domestic.
"
Person0,"Right.
"
Person0,"The $9 million and $10 million are incremental to that.
"
Person2,"Could I go back to <UNK>'s question.
"
Person2,"The impact that's being discussed there is we're going to have slow paper machines down when we do our number 19 furnace, we're changing the ID fan and doing some duct work and it'll be down for about 17 days, so that's not actually paper machine upgrades it's a recovery furnace upgrade.
"
Person1,"For Longview.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Operator, if there's one more question we'll take it.
"
Person0,"Otherwise we're going to --.
"
Person1,"Go work.
"
Person0,"Yes, we're going to go try to make some money.
"
Person0,"Well, you know, I'm not going to comment on the likelihood of a future price increase but I will say, in general terms, the market is tight.
"
Person0,"We're having some difficult conversations about allocating mill production and we don't see this ending anytime soon so the market is tight and remains tight.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Okay, so I just wanted to thank everybody for participating.
"
Person0,"We look forward to talking to you again in about two and a half, three months and if you have any follow-up questions you're welcome to contact any of us.
"
Person0,"Thank you again.
"
Person0,"Bye bye.
