Person2,"Yes, let me start there.
"
Person2,"So as far as the $80 million is concerned, I mean that's all on Ulta, right.
"
Person2,"So we're stepping up with the CapEx investment.
"
Person2,"And again, that $80 million, partly it's not just a boutique drop-in, right.
"
Person2,"So again, there's 500, roughly 500 individual boutique drop-ins across the chain.
"
Person2,"But we're going to take the opportunity, when we're in those stores, to also refresh our fragrance fixtures in those stores, and Ulta Beauty Collection fixturing as well.
"
Person2,"As well as other miscellaneous things, like you're in a store, touching it up and causing some chaos, you're going to take the opportunity to do what you think is best for the guest long-term.
"
Person2,"So that's how we're deploying the $80 million.
"
Person2,"Again, each vendor, we have a different set of economic terms with them.
"
Person2,"So I think by and large, it's kind of a payroll share kind of model, right.
"
Person2,"So again, they're trained, they're our associates, they're on our payroll.
"
Person2,"The vendors provide, our vendor partners provide excellent training for them.
"
Person2,"We kind of share the payroll model on a go-forward basis, and it takes awhile.
"
Person2,"Again, we install the boutiques up front, and it takes awhile for those to reach maturity, right.
"
Person2,"So again, as we go over time, we add more payroll resources there to make them more productive.
"
Person2,"So I think that's it in a nutshell.
"
Person2,"I guess, we could echo those comments that you've heard from others.
"
Person2,"We have -- there's no shortage of great real estate sites that we're seeing, as we look at proposals across the country.
"
Person2,"Again our stores, we have a typical, I guess, best-in-class kind of set of co-tenants that we would like to operate with.
"
Person2,"But we have proven and demonstrated over time, Ulta stores work on a wide variety of real estate locations and types.
"
Person2,"So feel very confident about our current pace of 100 stores a year, right, that we've talked about here, as our medium term target.
"
Person2,"We just came back, I guess, from ICSC here in the last day or so.
"
Person2,"And again, we've -- the landlords, the relationships that we have are very strong.
"
Person2,"We know Ulta is being sought out as a tenant of choice.
"
Person2,"We're proven traffic drivers to centers in the beauty category is something that many landlords, that's a piece of that offering, retail offering that they'd love to add to the mix overall.
"
Person2,"Yes, I mean, I don't -- we haven't, we're always very competitive, when we get into the rent structures and the economic terms of our deals.
"
Person2,"I mean, I think Ulta probably best-in-class, when you look at our operating model overall.
"
Person2,"So it's not like we're seeing some big step decreases in rent terms or anything like that, at least not at this stage.
"
Person2,"Now a lot of these liquidation events are kind of in process, I guess, I would say right now.
"
Person2,"So I guess, that's yet to be seen.
"
Person2,"And we don't -- it's not causing us to rethink the number of stores that we open every year, right.
"
Person2,"A 100 a year, again there's no magic around that, but that's been a comfortable pace for us, with the number of new associates we need to add to the mix overall, and that time of year that those stores usually get opened.
"
Person2,"All-in, when we think about that, a 100 is a kind of a good pace.
"
Person2,"Yes, no problem, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I guess, what I would say, is that yes, we have several urban, I guess, you'd call them stores in the fleet, and they do fine.
"
Person2,"As we're thinking about the future, I wouldn't say we've ever had a concerted urban strategy, right.
"
Person2,"So we don't have a lot of them.
"
Person2,"Our main strategy has been really in suburbs and in power centers, and lifestyle centers.
"
Person2,"We've talked about, we feel good about this 10,000 square foot store format, and the ability to hit at least 1,200, at least of that format.
"
Person2,"But when I reference that, we're also looking at what's the opportunity in smaller markets.
"
Person2,"And then also, what's the opportunity in places where the parcels of real estate would by definition be smaller.
"
Person2,"So whether it's urban centers or the downtown, maybe shopping area of high end suburbs, right.
"
Person2,"So we've got [two] with 2,500 -- two 5,000 square foot stores right now, that we're operating to learn about the dynamics of the different size box, and they're doing well.
"
Person2,"They're also learning a lot about the best way to operate that.
"
Person2,"And as we look at refreshing our view of store growth, urban is a question we're asking ourselves, and we'll look at.
"
Person2,"As you said obviously, the economics are different, but as we drive brand awareness across the country with our marketing efforts, we know that -- where will we go now.
"
Person2,"People know more about us than I think they would have in the past, right.
"
Person2,"So that's a good way or place to start.
"
Person2,"So more to come on that.
"
Person1,"Well, we're very happy with the loyalty program today, it's really a key asset for us.
"
Person1,"And it's a fair question, I mean, that's something that could be a good asset in the long run, right.
"
Person1,"Nothing to announce on that certainly, but it's certainly has a history in retail that's been successful for many retailers, no doubt.
"
Person1,"Okay, thank you.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"I'd just like to close by thanking our 26,000 associates for an incredible start to the year, and I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.
"
