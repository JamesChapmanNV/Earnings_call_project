Person2,"The goal we established was last year, and we said from Q3 2016 to this going out rate of Q4 2017 we'd save a gross $400 million.
"
Person2,"And then after some strategic investments, which include SolidFire, it would be a net of $130 million.
"
Person2,"If you impute my guide for OpEx, you can almost get there on an annualized rate between Q3 OpEx of 2016 annualized and the guide I gave for Q4.
"
Person2,"You can almost get to the whole $130 million.
"
Person2,"And when you add the savings associated with the services work we've done, you can more than get there.
"
Person2,"I haven't guided -- we haven't guided anything beyond that at this point.
"
Person2,"But as I said, transformation will still exist as we go forward.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I think in both of those cases our perspective is the long-term winner as we have demonstrated in the All-Flash Array market is the one that can take an architecture and serve the mainstream customer segment.
"
Person1,"There have been lots of companies that have gone after the early adopter segment with a subset of the features that enterprise customers really want and have failed in the long run.
"
Person1,"And so first to market doesn't necessarily mean the big winner, right.
"
Person1,"I think what we are trying to do with the hyperconverged segment is the same track record that we've demonstrated with the All-Flash Array segment, which is customers want mature enterprise data management features.
"
Person1,"They want performance consistency and scalability so that they don't have to have operationally a siloed environment.
"
Person1,"And hybrid cloud is really the architecture of the data center going forward, and they want true hybrid cloud integration.
"
Person1,"So we think that by offering those capabilities to customers, we will redefine the hyperconverged market, just like we did to the All-Flash Array market.
"
Person1,"Stay tuned.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with a return to top line growth and increasing profitability.
"
Person1,"We are expanding our opportunity by addressing an increasing range of strategic customer use cases.
"
Person1,"We've completely refreshed our portfolio of hybrid and All-Flash Arrays, delivered an industry leading storage efficiency guarantee to the market, expanding our cloud based services and soon we will introduce a next generation hyperconverged solution.
"
Person1,"All of this underpins our growing confidence in the future.
"
Person1,"We hope to see you in April at our investor event where with will talk more about the evolution of NetApp to lead in the next era of IT.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
