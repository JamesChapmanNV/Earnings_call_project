Person1,"Sure, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"So for tag if you look at it in two components the big drivers were janitorial and our facility services on the janitorial side.
"
Person1,"And overall we had about an $8 million increase year over year or roughly 12%.
"
Person1,"On janitorial we saw continued growth and <UNK> can allude to the specifics but we saw some continued growth in janitorial tag.
"
Person1,"And on the facility services, which growth in tag is truly pass-through so from a margin perspective it's not going to have the same impact as it does in janitorial, but we saw continued growth in tag on the AFS side.
"
Person0,"Yes, and what I would add, <UNK>, is typically in the first quarter we see good tag sales because we have the holidays baked into that but I think also there is a change in the firm.
"
Person0,"People understand that there's typically higher margins associated with tag.
"
Person0,"So as we focus on our EBITDA margins we are placing more emphasis on selling through tag.
"
Person0,"I hope this trend continues but again optimistic what we saw in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"Yes, I will take the first half of that question.
"
Person1,"So excluding tag our growth was right in line with our expectation from an enterprise perspective.
"
Person1,"And tag, as <UNK> alluded to we had good growth in tag but tag is a component of our overall revenue.
"
Person1,"So we don't strip it out when we look at organic in totality.
"
Person1,"So from an enterprise perspective our growth was right in line.
"
Person1,"We saw good growth in some of the segments and tag contributed proportionally to that growth.
"
Person0,"As you can imagine, <UNK>, with our 2020 transformation and redesigning this organization there's a lot of work being done by our key people.
"
Person0,"And really doing double duty, right.
"
Person0,"Because we still have to execute on your day job and put a lot of effort into how we're going to plan the organization going forward.
"
Person0,"And probably what I'm most proud of is that we're able to execute during the quarter in this period of transformation.
"
Person0,"So we don't see any headwinds as relating to the effort and the work that people have put in.
"
Person0,"And I would say our organization is completely aligned to this new structure.
"
Person0,"There's a lot of enthusiasm around it.
"
Person0,"And we're not getting a lot of complaints from people about how hard they are working.
"
Person0,"As a matter of fact, people are pretty excited about what the future is looking like.
"
Person0,"And as we go through this in month-after-month passes you can see the finish line ahead.
"
Person0,"And like I said we're excited about where we are today.
"
Person1,"Yes, absolutely.
"
Person1,"So let me take that.
"
Person1,"So the way we're looking at it is if you normalize last year for the margin as it relates to the insurance rates that we're charging the business currently and those rates we feel really confident and comfortable with those being the right insurance rate from a current-year expense standpoint.
"
Person1,"So if you look at where those rates would have been impacting the margin from last year we would've been roughly 2.6% give or take on an EBITDA margin.
"
Person1,"We provided somewhat of a bridge in the deck.
"
Person1,"We ended this quarter with a 3.4% EBITDA margin, so when you think about the 80 basis points it comes in a number of different components.
"
Person1,"Roughly 50 basis points is operational driven based on the factors we just discussed.
"
Person1,"2020 had a small impact, roughly 10, 13 basis points of impact and the rest is really going to be due to timing.
"
Person1,"We had some certain one-time items come in through the quarter from a benefit standpoint.
"
Person1,"We've delayed some investments that we were making.
"
Person1,"So that I would say is more of a timing issue.
"
Person1,"So we're really proud of what the organization was able to deliver from a margin perspective given the headwinds on insurance particularly.
"
Person1,"On the out-of-period insurance, as you recall late last year we did mention we're going to have a second review done primarily for our captive insurance.
"
Person1,"As part of that review we rolled forward the third quarter of last year's actuarial report.
"
Person1,"And based on the data we continue to see some unfavorable trends in the prior years and we've made an adjustment appropriately for those unfavorable trends and we will continue to monitor that going forward.
"
Person1,"But what we're comfortable with is the rate that we have for this year is the right rate and the business is operating with that total cost of risk.
"
Person1,"And we don't expect that current year to be adjusted this year or going forward.
"
Person1,"Let me answer the WOTC.
"
Person1,"So WOTC as you articulated there's a cumulative impact and then there's a full-year impact.
"
Person1,"The cumulative impact is the $0.20 that we've guided towards.
"
Person1,"In the quarter we had two components.
"
Person1,"One was a catch-up of 2015 which added roughly $0.09 to the quarter and then there's $0.02 related to 2016 WOTC which will continue to accrue for the balance of the year.
"
Person1,"So roughly the $0.20 is where we're seeing the guidance from WOTC being updated.
"
Person1,"Yes, on the buckets we don't see any major changes to the drivers.
"
Person1,"But we still feel pretty comfortable with what we articulated in terms of the headwinds being insurance and the benefits being 2020 in the operational.
"
Person1,"So we feel pretty good with those.
"
Person0,"Yes, look, we're always trying to strike a balance between growth and margin rate.
"
Person0,"Our focus and what we're putting out there is margin enhancement as one of the primary drivers of 2020 vision.
"
Person0,"But that's part and parcel to revenue growth.
"
Person0,"And what we're finding is we're just seeing a lot of collaboration in our firm for cross-selling.
"
Person0,"And I think what we're seeing now, especially when you saw the margin increase, is that is that message is resonating within the firm and as that resonates, with it is coming sales growth.
"
Person0,"So we're really proud we have 3.7% organic revenue growth and we're looking at our pipeline going forward.
"
Person0,"We'll feeling really good about the balance and how we're handling our forward really strategic approach towards picking up new business.
"
Person0,"But I don't think we ever really said 2020 vision was about how we exit big amounts of business.
"
Person0,"It's really about how we grow going forward.
"
Person1,"And let me add a little color to that as well.
"
Person1,"If you look at our healthcare business which has had, very small component of the business, had some challenges.
"
Person1,"And we exited a contract subsequent to Q1 that will improve the comps going forward for that business.
"
Person1,"So we are still taking a hard look at existing business on a renewal basis to make sure it makes sense.
"
Person1,"But to <UNK>'s point, this is not about culling revenue for the sake of culling revenue but where there's opportunities for us to improve the margin we will.
"
Person1,"And if it doesn't meet the margin profile on those renewals or there is not a glide path for that margin profile then we're taking a harder look at that business.
"
Person1,"Yes, so if you look at BSG and as we kind of articulated at the balance last year was BSG was a second-half story last year.
"
Person1,"So first two quarters last year we had some tough comps but they overdelivered in the second half.
"
Person1,"And that overdelivery is translating into a good pipeline and good bookings continuing in the quarter and we expect that for the ongoing quarter.
"
Person1,"If you do a comparison from Q3, Q4 of last year to what we expect the full year to be Q3 and Q4 will be more normalized.
"
Person1,"But overall we see good growth in our technical services business in particular.
"
Person0,"I was just going to also add if you look at Air Serv this quarter 15%-plus in organic revenue growth.
"
Person0,"So I think as we start shaping these industry group focuses or verticals you are going to see acceleration.
"
Person0,"We haven't put out exact guidelines yet because we are still going through the process but really the motivator for 2020 vision is to get focused by industry and really accelerate our growth.
"
Person1,"So we don't see any, I mean I think the summary is we don't see any wholesale headwinds in any of our businesses from a growth perspective.
"
Person1,"Could the growth taper in one and accelerate in the other.
"
Person1,"Absolutely, but at this point we feel pretty comfortable for the full year.
"
Person1,"We experienced some localized issues in Air Serv and some one-offs.
"
Person1,"The localized issues were specific to a particular region and the team there is keenly focusing on operationalizing it and getting back on track.
"
Person1,"They have a plan for that.
"
Person1,"So for full-year outlook from an operating profit percentage we're probably going to be in that 3.3% to 3.4% range.
"
Person1,"And that's really going to be a number of factors.
"
Person1,"Last year we had outside growth from our UK portion of Air Serv.
"
Person1,"It's going to be normalized.
"
Person1,"That portion has a much higher EBITDA and operating margin contribution.
"
Person1,"The US business has good or fantastic top-line growth but they had these one-off items that impacted the quarter and as I just mentioned, they have a plan in place to get back on track.
"
Person1,"So overall nothing systemic but something that we're obviously keenly focused on.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So overall if you think about SG&A there is a lot of costs related to our items impacting comparability.
"
Person1,"So it's difficult to look at it in totality given the pluses and minuses quarter over quarter and year over year.
"
Person1,"The way I would look at SG&A is obviously as part of 2020 some of the savings that are going to come out of or most of the savings are going to come out of the SG&A line that we'll be operating savings as well as it relates to the organizational design.
"
Person1,"So the way I would characterize it is the savings that we have both from an SG&A perspective impact from 2020 plus the operating perspective is going to get us to that $10 million to $20 million realized savings.
"
Person1,"So it's a little bit challenging given a year of transformation and the puts and takes to get to an exact number.
"
Person1,"But as we move on throughout the year we will provide additional clarity.
"
Person1,"Yes, so we're right on track with our plan.
"
Person1,"So many of the actions that we took from an organization standpoint happened late in the quarter.
"
Person1,"So from a run rate basis we're approximately at the end of the quarter roughly $11 million on a run rate basis.
"
Person1,"What actually translated into the quarter was the 13 basis, roughly 13 basis points that I articulated or $2 million plus or minus.
"
Person1,"As the actions in the organization get further defined through Q2 we will be able to provide an update.
"
Person1,"But we're well on our way with realized savings that we articulated and we feel really good about it.
"
Person0,"Yes, for us it's all about whether or not we're hitting our internal targets for milestones both in terms of the process and moving the process along as well as the savings.
"
Person0,"And we're just so happy to report that we are on track.
"
Person0,"Yes, so it's not because of the vertical approach because we really haven't gotten into these verticals because we're still planning the organization.
"
Person0,"So you won't start seeing the movement towards vertical operations until the second half of the year.
"
Person0,"In terms of sustainability, again Q1 is typically strong because you have the holiday sales in there.
"
Person0,"But again I do believe because of the focus on margin enhancement by our team you'll see continued focus there.
"
Person0,"How sustainable the actual increases are that we put on the quarter over quarter we don't know yet, but again we're encouraged by what we're seeing and more importantly what we're hearing across the organization in terms of focus.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So tag really has an impact on two business lines, facilities services and janitorial.
"
Person1,"On the facilities services side it's a pass-through, so from a margin perspective there's really not a lot of margin uplift.
"
Person1,"Good sales and we can penetrate it additionally and we expect the growth to be in line with historical averages.
"
Person1,"Janitorial, obviously the margin profile from tag sales is much higher.
"
Person1,"And back to <UNK>'s point, we have a Q1 uplift due to the holiday season and the focus from the operational standpoint given the margin focus is going to be driving the tag.
"
Person1,"So I think that's going to be continuing to be a focus area.
"
Person1,"We don't provide annual guidance on tag but it is a focus area and one we're going to continue to look at going forward.
"
Person1,"I don't think we have ever given janitorial at its peak or where we are today.
"
Person1,"But what I can say it's roughly $180 million to $200 million give or take on an annual basis.
"
Person1,"Tag, how they come in and how they translate is going to obviously be contingent on the time of year and certain events.
"
Person1,"So it's a little bit out of our control in terms of the timing.
"
Person1,"We just feel like it's a pretty good indicator of the focus on margin and an early indicator from an operational standpoint of where we want to be.
"
Person0,"And the one thing I would say, <UNK>, is you read about a lot of headwinds in the economy and I can tell you just from talking to our people and getting out and traveling to the different regions, we are not seeing any headwinds from our clients yet in terms of pulling back or grabbing us for conversations about how we cut costs right now.
"
Person0,"So we don't see any reason why our tag performance should deteriorate over the course of this year.
"
Person0,"Look, we have our internal targets that we don't necessarily disclose, right.
"
Person0,"But our hope is that if 2020 vision is successful we will be able to accelerate the compensation.
"
Person0,"We have very defined targets that we've put out and our internal people know about it.
"
Person0,"And so we're optimistic that if everything triggers the right way our people will be well compensated and really have a tight link between how they perform, how they perform and how they get compensated, the whole kind of pay for performance.
"
Person0,"That is the culture that we are driving in the firm.
"
Person1,"Yes, it's a redistribution.
"
Person1,"The targets have changed.
"
Person1,"Our objectives have changed.
"
Person1,"And to <UNK>'s point if we overachieve our objectives similar to prior years there would be an overachievement but from an overall bonus pool its apples to apples.
"
Person1,"We haven't changed the dollars amount allocated based on the objectives we've set.
"
Person1,"Yes, so let me break that down into two components.
"
Person1,"So for this fiscal year, we've aligned compensation to the main drivers that we're looking for, both short term and long term, and that's margin growth, revenue growth and safety and risk drivers.
"
Person1,"As it relates to the cross-selling initiatives we have programs in place, they are more commission-based programs in place, so that's not really the bonus program.
"
Person1,"And as we move forward into 2017 and 2018, the localized programs which in this current year are enterprise-wide will become much more focused on driving the behaviors and driving the performance at the vertical level.
"
Person1,"So you'll see more of the verticalization cross-selling and I think that's what you're alluding to as part of next year's compensation plan.
"
Person1,"Not as part of this year's compensation plan because we're not operating in that framework today.
"
Person0,"And I think the other way you could think about it in our current format we're more organized by service line.
"
Person0,"If you have a janitorial contract you're motivated to cross-sell some services but you're motivated on a commission basis.
"
Person0,"When we move to a vertical-based organization you're responsible for the customer, you're not just responsible for janitorial.
"
Person0,"So when you're controlling that customer, when you're controlling that P&L, you're much more motivated to bring services in and really have an end-to-end experience for that client.
"
Person0,"And that's how we're going to be measuring people's performance.
"
Person0,"So it's going to be a very different paradigm at ABM in really 2017.
"
Person0,"Yes, so I would look at this in a couple of different ways.
"
Person0,"First of all, we have a really good group of people that understand customers, understand our services.
"
Person0,"But as part of any transformation you bring in talent from the outside and we are bringing in people from the outside.
"
Person0,"We just brought in a really strong performer, a gentleman named Dave Carpenter who's going to be running our education vertical and has a terrific background in that area.
"
Person0,"So it's always good to bring in new talent.
"
Person0,"But the third leg of this besides the existing people and bringing in new people is the training.
"
Person0,"And as part of 2020 vision we have a whole other work stream on training and talent development and you're going to see new people coming into the organization to fill that area.
"
Person0,"So we're real excited about that because we know part of the transformation includes structural change to the organization.
"
Person0,"But the other piece of it is developing the tools to help acceleration.
"
Person0,"And if you look at how we've messaged way back to even Investor Day we said there are a number of different phases to this transformation.
"
Person0,"The first phase is developing the structure and the organization and putting people into seats.
"
Person0,"But the second phase that we're going into in April is about creating the tools, creating the business plans, creating everything around accelerating the business once the organization is structured.
"
Person0,"So you bring up a great point and it's something that is one of our key work streams.
"
Person0,"So energy has been one of the huge focuses of the firm over the last two or three years and you've seen some of our acquisitions in the ABES.
"
Person0,"One of our latest acquisitions, CTS, is all about energy and power, working in data centers, working on smart grids.
"
Person0,"And we have a gentleman on the West Coast named Tom Bowen who's very focused on the energy sector.
"
Person0,"So we see this as a trend that's continuing.
"
Person0,"And we think our glide path in this area is playing right into where the whole energy movement is heading.
"
Person0,"So we're excited about our trajectory in that space.
"
Person0,"Yes, so <UNK>, we're not breaking this out necessarily separately.
"
Person0,"But I will tell you that baked into our estimates in organizational savings includes net investments.
"
Person0,"So this isn't just about taking cost out.
"
Person0,"So when we've talked externally about our cost savings targets they are always met targets, so we factor them in.
"
Person0,"We have timing and cadence for everything and we're taking it one step at a time.
"
Person0,"So this will not be a setback at all.
"
Person0,"It won't be a setback at all.
"
Person0,"It's all part of the milestones that we set out for this project.
"
Person1,"And <UNK> I think if you look at the organizational design there may be certain areas where we're not going to be filling the position immediately.
"
Person1,"As we build out the organization there's going to be gaps in that organizational design.
"
Person1,"We're targeting the $30 million-plus of half the savings coming out of the organization plus some of the procurement savings from a cost perspective.
"
Person1,"Those are firm numbers.
"
Person1,"So you may actually see it appear to be that we're and ahead of where we anticipate because those investments haven't been made in necessary lockstep with the cost out.
"
Person1,"But again we're committed to what we've articulated as our goal on 2020 from a cost perspective and we're well on our way.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So there are two components.
"
Person1,"One was an isolated settlement of some certain tax audits that we had in the business which we don't anticipate occurring going forward.
"
Person1,"The other is the conversion of managed versus leased properties in the quarter.
"
Person1,"And as you know, leased properties come with higher risk and reward and in the quarter the leases underperformed.
"
Person1,"So we will continue to monitor the performance of the properties as it relates to leased.
"
Person1,"We don't expect it to continue at the same level of conversions from managed to lease that we experienced in Q4, Q1.
"
Person1,"But that will be something that we continue to look at going forward and that's one where it's going to increase the risk of our profitability based on the exposure to leases.
"
Person1,"And don't forget insurance also plays a big component of the margin decrease year over year.
"
Person0,"So thanks everyone for participating.
"
Person0,"We appreciate the questions and as I said we're encouraged at the start.
"
Person0,"We still have a long way to go but we are on the road.
"
Person0,"And we have a highly motivated management team and a highly motivated organization that's excited about where we're heading.
"
Person0,"So thank you for the time and we look forward to messaging back in the second quarter.
"
