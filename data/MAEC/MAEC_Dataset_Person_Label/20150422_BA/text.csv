Person2,"Yes, I put it into three main areas, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"R&D, we do expect R&D to pick up a little bit in the back half, with the, in particular, the 777X ramping up.
"
Person2,"We'll have more 787-9 deliveries, 787-9 deliveries, and then with more 747s, as well.
"
Person2,"So that's the -- I'll say the dilutive impact for the margins, going through the balance of the year.
"
Person2,"Having said that, obviously, we got everybody extremely focused on continued good productivity, and we will through the balance of the year.
"
Person2,"But it's really that mix that's driving it.
"
Person2,"I would say traditionally, as you know, we're back-loaded.
"
Person2,"But third and fourth quarter will be heavier than first and second quarter.
"
Person2,"And again, progress payments, milestones, and then just delivery profile.
"
Person1,"We don't mention commitments unless things are largely done.
"
Person1,"And so things are largely done.
"
Person1,"And there's timing considerations, and in some cases, driven by customer requirements and things.
"
Person1,"And so we let the customer decide when to finally approve and release.
"
Person1,"But I have a very high degree of confidence in the 25 number.
"
Person2,"We don't anticipate any change from what we talked about when we gave guidance.
"
Person2,"So again, I see advances about flattish year over year --
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person3,"Thank you.
"
Person3,"We'll continue this morning with media questions for <UNK> and <UNK>.
"
Person3,"If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002.
"
Person3,"Operator, we're ready for the first question.
"
Person3,"And in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Listen, you're right, they decided not to go through with the election.
"
Person1,"Presumably because they felt they didn't have the votes, but you'd have to ask them specifically about why they withdrew.
"
Person1,"We are very happy with our relationship with our teammates down in South Carolina.
"
Person1,"The site is technically, and on a manufacturing, certification, engineering basis, doing very well.
"
Person1,"I'm very pleased with its progress.
"
Person1,"But I also highly value the relationship that we all have with our employees in Puget Sound.
"
Person1,"One group has a union, one doesn't.
"
Person1,"We prefer to have a direct relationship with our employees, but when they choose to have a union, we want to work with them.
"
Person1,"So it's not either/or.
"
Person1,"Our task is to work with both environments, and to grow them to their potential.
"
Person1,"But very happy with developments down in South Carolina.
"
Person1,"That place is really doing well.
"
Person1,"Didn't see Airbus' comments today, but I think our supply chain has anticipated robust growth, probably from both of us.
"
Person1,"They see the orders in the backlogs, as we do.
"
Person1,"We spend a lot of time talking with our supply chain, and working on them with readiness -- on readiness issues, I should say.
"
Person1,"We've announced 52.
"
Person1,"They count a little bit differently.
"
Person1,"60 is not -- is roughly the same as 52, 54.
"
Person1,"I've forgotten how the math works.
"
Person1,"But I think the supply chain is ready, and we've spent a lot of time investing in getting them ready.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I'm not sure about the last number.
"
Person2,"There's no anticipated charge here, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Our estimate --
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"I don't know where they got it from.
"
Person2,"Our estimates have taken all that into consideration on first flight, as well as completing the balance of the airplanes.
"
Person2,"Certainly, there's work left to be done here, and we're going to get the airplane into the air sometime this summer.
"
Person2,"And that will be fully militarized, and we'll see how that goes, and continue to execute the balance of the program.
"
Person2,"But there's no change to the financial position on the program at this point.
"
Person3,"Operator, we have time for one last question.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Yes, good morning.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think that all the problems are not resolved.
"
Person1,"We do have a high confidence in the plan to resolve them.
"
Person1,"We have -- and it's because our people are deeply involved with them in the resolution.
"
Person1,"We don't anticipate a lot of it being worked through until the end of the second quarter.
"
Person1,"But we've all figured out a way to work together, that it's not going to disrupt our production plans.
"
Person1,"And we're pleased to see their response now to getting this fixed.
"
Person3,"That concludes our earnings call.
"
Person3,"Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002.
"
Person3,"Thank you.
