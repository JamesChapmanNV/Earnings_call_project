Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"That demonstration project that we mentioned will not complete during this public comment period.
"
Person1,"I think that study be a little longer study.
"
Person1,"So that is going to play out over the coming months.
"
Person1,"So it is not going to add to the 36 publications that we already have during that timeframe.
"
Person1,"From a growth perspective, I think one of the things that was important for us to look at is what did the trends look like after we were able to discuss the data from AMPLE.
"
Person1,"And as we mentioned, we did in fact see when you saw December and January data compared to October November data, you actually saw a nice uptick in demand that was demonstrative of the impact that our sales teams were having.
"
Person1,"So I think it's the fact that the sales force realignment has been completed.
"
Person1,"It is the fact that we've got really good messaging out there and a talented team that is out there being able to give physicians continued confidence.
"
Person1,"And it's looking at the trends that we have seen in the last couple of months.
"
Person1,"I think those things together have us confident that we are going to return to sequential growth in the second half.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"As you know having covering the industry for a while, predicting these things is difficult.
"
Person1,"What I can say is that the health economic data that we discussed is recent data.
"
Person1,"And the fact that we have been able to generate that data in United Healthcare's database as well as Humana and Anthem's databases -- and those analyses are either done at this point or very close to that -- that speaks loudly to the insurance carriers because these are their own members, and we can demonstrate cost savings in their own plans.
"
Person1,"And so we think that will be very impactful, and that data is either available now or will be available quite shortly.
"
Person1,"And so obviously you can imagine we are aggressively having those discussions about not only the utility of the debt but the health economic impact in their own members.
"
Person1,"And that will continue to be a high priority for us.
"
Person0,"This concludes our earnings call.
"
Person0,"A replay will be available via webcast on our website site for one week.
"
Person0,"Thank you again for joining us this afternoon.
