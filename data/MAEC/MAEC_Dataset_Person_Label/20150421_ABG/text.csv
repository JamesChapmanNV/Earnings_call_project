Person,Sentence
Person1,"You know, I think it's been competitive for a while.
"
Person1,"I think there's always going to be a little bit of movement up and down between the quarters.
"
Person1,"There's pressure on used; there's pressure on new.
"
Person1,"The transparency of the Internet and everything that's involved, I think we are fairly stable.
"
Person1,"Over the next two years, we will certainly add the techs that we need to.
"
Person1,"Our facilities aren't at capacity.
"
Person1,"We have the ability to add the technicians.
"
Person1,"And with that, the business will come with it.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"No, the business has been pretty stable for us there, and we really don't.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Jimmy, I don't know that there's some spring-loaded benefit to used naturally coming forward from this phenomenon.
"
Person2,"I would say, though, that we do have the ability, on the reconditioning side and the Parts and Service side, to put additional work into our cars.
"
Person2,"We have done that over the last couple of years.
"
Person2,"As you mentioned, we've shown pretty healthy increases in internal rates, and that's built into the cost of the car.
"
Person2,"And when you consider we've been able to achieve that and hold our margins on used relatively stable -- albeit down a little bit this quarter, but relatively stable -- I think, overall, it's a pretty good job.
"
Person2,"That would -- that's correct.
"
Person2,"And over time, we would expect those two to migrate back together -- for the (multiple speakers) to be driven by used vehicle volume.
"
Person2,"Yes, that's correct.
"
Person2,"The current availability is at $90 million.
"
Person2,"I don't know that I'm following the question.
"
Person2,"We look at that as -- we only have $10 million borrowed on our used vehicle line today.
"
Person2,"We have $90 million additional to borrow.
"
Person2,"It's a very cheap financing source for us that we intend to utilize.
"
Person2,"But as far as investment in, and from an operational standpoint, how many vehicles we have on the ground, I think is where you're getting to, we are constantly evaluating our dealerships for our day's supply, and having adequate inventory to sell through to our customers.
"
Person2,"I would look at that $90 million differently.
"
Person2,"I would look at that $90 million as a line that we can pull on when we want cash to deploy.
"
Person2,"I don't look at it -- well, I look at the operational standpoint of building inventory totally separately.
"
Person2,"If we have a opportunity to grow our used vehicle business by deploying capital into inventory, we'll go ahead and do that.
"
Person1,"I was going to jump in and say kind of the way I think -- if you were talking to a General Manager in the store, the way they would think about it is, they want to have 30 to 35 days worth of used vehicle inventory on the front line.
"
Person1,"That -- we then roll that up into a dollar investment in used vehicle inventory.
"
Person1,"We kind of put that completely to one side; work hard to stay in that 30 to 35 range.
"
Person1,"That seems to be a number that keeps us efficient.
"
Person1,"We have internal rules that once a vehicle ages much beyond that, we start to force that car's movement within the system or we force it to auction.
"
Person1,"The line itself we kind of look at as a payable.
"
Person1,"And right now we are only using a portion of that.
"
Person1,"And what is the excess essentially is essentially liquidity that we've got available to us to redeploy.
"
Person1,"Sure thing.
"
Person1,"I think there's -- well, I'll start.
"
Person1,"It seems we're always talking to someone.
"
Person1,"We are talking to people today, so there's always a transaction that's being contemplated.
"
Person1,"But I would say today, at least from our perspective, there seems to be a lot more talk about consolidation in the press than what we see happening on The Street.
"
Person1,"The -- I think seller's expectations continue to increase for a number of different reasons.
"
Person1,"But there are still people who are willing to sell car stores.
"
Person1,"We still see transactions that look like they could potentially get done at reasonable prices, but we are seeing fewer and fewer of those.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Well, maybe -- this is <UNK> -- maybe I'll take a first shot at it.
"
Person1,"I think there's a number of things that are happening in the market.
"
Person1,"Luxury, you're right.
"
Person1,"Luxury is a higher-price vehicle typically generate larger margins, but many of the luxury manufacturers are also starting to sell more and more lower-priced units, which we move in the market much lower grosses.
"
Person1,"I think that's playing into the market.
"
Person1,"<UNK> talked earlier about the transparency that we see in both new and used.
"
Person1,"I mean, that's a reality today.
"
Person1,"We look at this $2,100 number that you talk about, and even if you just look us over the last nine quarters, that number has been very stable.
"
Person1,"It feels to us like it will continue to be stable.
"
Person1,"I mean, yes, it varies quarter-to-quarter, but we've been in this $2,000 to $2,100 range for quite some time now, and we believe that it will continue to exist.
"
Person1,"<UNK> or <UNK>, do you have anything to add.
"
Person3,"No, I agree.
"
Person1,"No, we're -- I think the overriding factor for us is that we think -- we don't know exactly what our optimal capital structure is, but we think getting leverage into that 2.5 to 3 times range is where we should be.
"
Person1,"We are working to head in that direction.
"
Person1,"We are not -- we don't think we are smart enough to determine what is the exact price that we should be buying or not be buying.
"
Person1,"I think we think of it as more as an exercise in which, with respect to share repurchase, we are returning capital to our shareholders.
"
Person1,"You could argue that it's essentially no different from a dividend.
"
Person1,"What we do do, though, is we look at what's the relative return on investment that we can achieve when we buy a share of stock versus pursuing internal opportunities or pursuing acquisitions.
"
Person1,"That becomes the trade-off for us.
"
Person1,"But we are very much interested in taking advantage of the opportunity we have to deploy some liquidity, and we will continue to move down this path.
"
Person1,"I would just point out that we have 88 stores, core stores, and three Q auto stores.
"
Person1,"So it's a very small part of our business today.
"
Person1,"It is not a material amount of our used vehicle sales.
"
Person1,"I don't believe that we are disrupting any markets.
"
Person1,"I think we've got something on our hands here that's very interesting.
"
Person1,"We are making progress; we're selling cars.
"
Person1,"We are learning.
"
Person1,"We are learning how to solve this puzzle of creating a marketplace where we can retail cars that otherwise would've found their way to the auction.
"
Person1,"We've still got a lot to learn, but we like the fact that at three stores, it's very manageable.
"
Person1,"And we think the smart thing to do is continue to work on those stores.
"
Person1,"There are some more technologies coming to play in those stores.
"
Person1,"There could be -- we are working with our technology partners.
"
Person1,"We are working with our financing partners.
"
Person1,"We are experimenting with a number of different things and it's -- we think it's just right the way we are doing it, and this is what we want to stay focused on right now.
"
Person1,"It's -- we're trying to figure out who the customers are.
"
Person1,"And we are learning that the customers in each of the markets are different.
"
Person1,"So -- and one of the markets, for example, is primary subprime.
"
Person1,"But in another market, we can sell luxury cars.
"
Person1,"It's -- I guess I would come back to kind of our overriding view, is that we are not consuming a lot of capital with this.
"
Person1,"It is not terribly disruptive to our core operations.
"
Person1,"We've carved out a group of people who are dedicated to it.
"
Person1,"And we are learning.
"
Person1,"And I think that's the important thing.
"
Person1,"We are learning, I think, a brand is important -- obviously, a brand is important.
"
Person1,"And we do believe that as these stores continue to operate and get more time under their belt, they are becoming more relevant in their marketplace.
"
Person1,"They are becoming more relevant online.
"
Person1,"And we think those are some of the things that are helping them continue to improve their volumes.
"
Person1,"And we've just got to continue down that path.
"
Person1,"It's going to take some time, and -- but we feel like we are headed in the right direction.
"
Person1,"And it is well worth our effort and your investor, our investor, our investments as shareholders, to give this thing a shot.
"
Person1,"In fact, we think we would be remiss if we didn't give it a shot, because we believe there's a real opportunity here.
"
Person1,"Oh, I think it's a great time to be in the car business.
"
Person1,"Just the fact that the product is absolutely phenomenal, we continue to see new product every day.
"
Person1,"Interest rates are as low as they have ever been.
"
Person1,"I don't -- I mean, inventories are under control.
"
Person1,"We've learned, I think, to become much more better with our processes.
"
Person1,"We continue to find ways to improve productivity, so our flow-throughs have been, I think, very healthy.
"
Person1,"It's really hard to find much to complain about in today's marketplace.
"
Person2,"Yes, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"We commented that we think we can be at 69% to -- 68% to 69% over the remainder of the year.
"
Person2,"We think we could operate well within that range.
"
Person2,"Obviously, a lot of the ratio is dependent upon business growth and gross profit growth.
"
Person2,"So, as our business grows, we are able to drive that even lower than those levels.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Well, that concludes our discussion for today.
"
Person1,"We appreciate you joining us, and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
"
