Person1,"Hello <UNK>, this is <UNK>, on the unit volume which is the underlying subscribers for circulation, we're down in the mid- to high-single digits, as a percentage.
"
Person1,"And, as I called out, on the financial side we're actually up in the low single digits; we were up 2.8% and so we see a continuation of those trends as we look forward.
"
Person1,"You got all of those correct.
"
Person0,"We expect it to still be a pretty unstable category going forward.
"
Person0,"There's just a lot of trouble as you know in the major brick and mortar retail sector, so while we had maybe a little bit of a better trend in the fourth quarter, we are not confident enough to say that is here to stay.
"
Person0,"So I think our normal assumptions of down 10% for the total traditional category is probably safe.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Yes, over the last three years, that is true, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We don't feel confident enough to feel good.
"
Person0,"Preprint has had a pretty stable run for quite a few years, but the status of the bricks and mortar retailers both regional and national has us feeling unsecure enough that we're putting it in traditional not in a stable category.
"
Person1,"Sure, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"On the 48% of our revenue comes from the traditional category and we expect that to decline about 10%.
"
Person1,"So call that $55 million and then the 52 % of our revenue, the biggest one is circulation at $420 million that we think will grow about 2%, so call that $8 million plus.
"
Person1,"Propel is a $53 million revenue category that we think will continue to grow at 70% or 75%.
"
Person1,"And then we have our events business which we think is a double from 7% to 15% and then a few other smaller things like our business publications division.
"
Person1,"So when you take the pluses that we have in each of the revenue categories, in our 52% of stable to growing revenue, you come up with more than $55 million that we expect the decline to be on the traditional print side.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
