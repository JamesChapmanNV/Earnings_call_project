Person1,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I'll talk a little bit about that.
"
Person1,"Pilot availability clearly, particularly for the 50-seat operation, is an issue for us which does indeed affect the ability of our Express operators to fly the schedule.
"
Person1,"And moreover, the 50-seat product is something that is not as good a product as the 76-seaters are.
"
Person1,"For example, the new Embraer 175s that are in the market are a spectacular product.
"
Person1,"It's a very attractive airplane, very comfortable airplane.
"
Person1,"It has Wi-Fi.
"
Person1,"It has putting first-class food up front.
"
Person1,"It has better ancillary revenue opportunities of seats, and it's a very good product.
"
Person1,"But the shift of pilots, or reduction in the availability of pilots for smaller airplanes, is clearly affecting us.
"
Person1,"As it is affecting all of our competitors who operate this aircraft.
"
Person1,"It's fair to assume that, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"A lot depends upon on earnings.
"
Person1,"But to your point, we tend to build a lot more cash in the first and second quarters.
"
Person1,"And we expect very strong cash generation there.
"
Person1,"We have a goal, though, of being free cash flow positive in every quarter.
"
Person1,"And given the earnings profile of this business, that's not an unreasonable assumption.
"
Person1,"Again, it depends upon your earnings assumption.
"
Person1,"But yes, potentially.
"
Person3,"Well, I think it's reasonable to assume that as we conclude our existing share repurchase program that we'll be in the market with something additional.
"
Person3,"Whether it be a share repurchase dividend, whatever we think is the best way to return cash to shareholders at that point in time.
"
Person3,"Thank you.
"
Person3,"<UNK>rey, this is <UNK>.
"
Person3,"The 747 is something that we do intend to keep for a few more years.
"
Person3,"We have a couple coming out of our fleet in the near future.
"
Person3,"But some of these, we've made some improvements to the operating reliability of the aircraft.
"
Person3,"And we could expect to keep them for another few years.
"
Person3,"They have another sort of big maintenance event in the 2020 timeframe.
"
Person3,"That'll be another decision point for us.
"
Person3,"Whether we want to extend them further at that point or go ahead and retire them.
"
Person3,"We have not disclosed which model we substituted.
"
Person3,"And, we might not elaborate on the discount.
"
Person3,"(laughter) That's something we'd like to keep us between us and Boeing.
"
Person3,"You bet.
"
Person3,"We're still a big believer in the 787.
"
Person3,"It's a great aircraft in our fleet today.
"
Person3,"The 777-300ER is also a very good aircraft and happens to have the best reliability of any plane in the sky today.
"
Person3,"We have an opportunity to put that in some markets that it's a better aircraft than with the 787 or some of our other existing planes out there today.
"
Person3,"So this is all part of normal fleet planning that we do from time to time.
"
Person3,"And there's nothing to read into this about the 787.
"
Person3,"I won't give you a specific route.
"
Person3,"But clearly, it integrates well with the 777 we fly out of Newark.
"
Person3,"It allows us to upgauge Newark, which has always been a strategy of ours given the constraints there and the demand that we're seeing in New York with the hub and how it's working in New York.
"
Person3,"So that's a great aircraft to upgauge in New York with that 777-300.
"
Person3,"We haven't disclosed what the fourth quarter in terms of international in total.
"
Person3,"We are bringing our Atlantic capacity to flat to down year over year.
"
Person3,"Again, for us, we've been very much focused on capacity discipline.
"
Person3,"So our Japan capacity, for instance, in the first quarter was down 11%.
"
Person3,"It's already planned to be down 7% in the fourth quarter.
"
Person3,"So we've been ahead of this as we create the flexibility in our fleet plan to match capacity and demand.
"
Person3,"It won't be this year.
"
Person0,"Okay, with that, we're out of time and we'll conclude.
"
Person0,"Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today.
"
Person0,"Please call Human Relations for your further questions.
"
Person0,"We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
"
Person0,"Goodbye.
"
