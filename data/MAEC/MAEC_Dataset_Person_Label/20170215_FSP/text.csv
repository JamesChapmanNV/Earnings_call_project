Person3,"<UNK>, this is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person3,"The range that we've been giving for total cost on 801 Marquette has been in the $15 million to $20 million range.
"
Person3,"The size of the project increased by about 8000 square feet and so we have just narrowed that range down to be approximately $20 million because we think we will be at the higher end of that range now.
"
Person3,"As far as timing of the expensing of those expenses costs, <UNK>, I don't know if you want to comment on that, but I would expect a number of those expenses to come due throughout the current course of the year.
"
Person3,"We'll have to look into how much has been expended.
"
Person3,"I don't have that number right in front of me.
"
Person0,"Actually, we disclosed it.
"
Person0,"We do disclose in the supplemental, I believe our cost in that now is about $8.9 million, so we've got some room to run in 2017 for more capital to spend.
"
Person0,"But I think the key point there, <UNK>, is that we've increased the square footage in the building and I think we're still within the $15 million to $20 million range.
"
Person0,"So I think the rent growth -- I think it's a better picture than where it was.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, this is <UNK> again.
"
Person3,"We are-- in terms of the mortgages that FSP holds on some of our single assets, we are anticipating the potential for some dispositions that would falter those repayments this year.
"
Person3,"And we will keep you posted as we proceed through the year, but there are a couple on deck that are possibilities for this year.
"
Person0,"This is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person0,"It's primarily a function of new leasing is when straight-line rent goes positive and some of the leasing that we did in the third and fourth quarter is what picked that up.
"
Person0,"And also from the acquisition that we made in December for Dominion Tower.
"
Person0,"That was part of it as well.
"
Person3,"No problem.
"
Person2,"There's been a combination of both of those, <UNK>, but what we're doing is looking at the remaining lease term of all the leases we have when we acquire the building and setting straight-line rents.
"
Person2,"So in most cases the leases have increasing rents each year, so we're sort of starting off with positive straight-line rent until we meet the midpoint of the leases that we acquire.
"
Person2,"So, you know, I think it's more a function of that then above and below market leases.
"
Person2,"I don't have a number for you on those.
"
Person2,"We do evaluate each one of those individually.
"
Person3,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"This is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person3,"The GAAP yield for the first full year is expected at about 6.9%, and the first full year cash yield is expected at about 6.2%.
"
Person3,"You're welcome.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Our expectations is to be a net seller in 2017.
"
Person3,"Well right now were not expecting acquisitions, so I'd rather not give a disposition range because there's a variety of scenarios that we've looked at.
"
Person3,"We will continue to monitor all five of our markets for opportunities, but our expectation is, broadly speaking, to be a net seller and to work on our objective of replacing the bridge financing for Dominion Towers.
"
Person3,"What I'm seeing out there is there are opportunities out there and we'll keep our eyes open.
"
Person3,"But that's not our expectation.
"
Person3,"Yep.
"
Person3,"You're welcome.
"
Person1,"Just to say thank you everyone for tuning in to the call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
