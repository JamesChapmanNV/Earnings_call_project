Person0,"And we'll have time for one more question, please.
"
Person2,"I think, in terms of the ticket pricing and AUR increases that we're seeing in Q1, I don't think we're seeing any resistance at this point.
"
Person2,"It's really -- it's all driven primarily by either innovation, like the Flex shorts in men's, continued roll out of Flex in denim, and far expanded assortment of Denim X in women's shorts.
"
Person2,"Other categories like dresses, we have better fabric, better fashion.
"
Person2,"The customer is recognizing all of this as a good value for her or for him, and I don't think we're seeing -- I don't think it's a headwind, or a challenging the reception to the product.
"
Person2,"In terms of promotional cadence, as I said earlier, it is our goal to be less promotional in Q1, than a year previously.
"
Person2,"And that's how our plans sit today, and that's how the momentum we're seeing in the business is consistent with that so far.
"
Person2,"So I think that we'll be able to do that.
"
Person2,"It does seem like from, the mall environment, it does seem like some others are starting to be, or attempting to be a little less promotional as well, which I think it can only be a win for us.
"
Person2,"So I feel optimistic, that with the product that we have, with the reception we're seeing so far, and with the already less promotional stance we've taken, that it looks good.
"
Person0,"That concludes our call today.
"
Person0,"Thanks for your participation and continued -- (technical difficulties).
