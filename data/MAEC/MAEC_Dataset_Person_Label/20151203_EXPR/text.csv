Person2,"From a productivity standpoint, our outlet stores are more productive.
"
Person2,"As we said before, they are 1.5 times more productive than our retail stores.
"
Person2,"Some of our other metrics -- the AUR of the outlet locations is about 20% to 25% lower than the AUR of the retail locations.
"
Person2,"But also, from an AUC standpoint, our AUC is about 20% lower.
"
Person2,"And therefore, when you look at the merchandise margin, the merchandise margin of the outlet locations is close to the overall merchandise margin of the retail locations.
"
Person2,"As you move down to the P&L from a B&O standpoint, the B&O of the outlet location is fairly attractive, given the rent profile.
"
Person2,"And from an SG&A standpoint, it is similar to the retail business.
"
Person2,"So overall, the margin for the outlets continues to be very favorable to us.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"I think the number one thing is continuing to offer the best fashion that is available out there, and in a differentiated way.
"
Person1,"And continuing to offer our exclusive product and elevating our brand.
"
Person1,"I think that is the number one big opportunity for us.
"
Person1,"And we can continue to do that.
"
Person3,"And we have made big strides this year with several areas of inventory discipline.
"
Person3,"While we've made big strides, there's still more opportunity there, from holding more back in reserve, as <UNK> talked about a minute ago, to, while we have a good, pretty fast supply chain today, looking for opportunities to continue to increase the speed of the supply chain as well.
"
Person3,"So we think there is still big opportunity there, along with the growth in the outlet channel.
"
Person1,"In addition to that, we are moving all our deliveries -- relevant deliveries -- back to the West Coast now, as well.
"
Person1,"So that's also another opportunity for us.
"
Person3,"But the good news is, as <UNK> said, we are bucking the trend to some extent with traffic in-stores, which is a positive.
"
Person3,"And I think that a lot of that is driven by the brand work that we have done, along with the great product that we have in the store.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Well, what happened last year with the e-commerce business was, we had specific e-commerce-only promotions that we ran last year.
"
Person3,"And we made the decision this year to have a single view to the customer around promotional activity.
"
Person3,"Whether it be in stores or online, it should be the same customer experience, a consistent experience to the customer.
"
Person3,"So we pulled off some of the e-comm-only promotions that we had on last year.
"
Person3,"And that is what led to the 6% comp online in the third quarter.
"
Person3,"We believe this is absolutely the right thing to do, from the long-term health of the business, and that is should be able to help us overall long-term with the overall customer experience.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, look, the way we're working it here is, we are constantly looking at continuous improvements in every area of the business.
"
Person1,"And there are clearly opportunities still with our sourcing, for us to be able to get faster.
"
Person1,"I think some of the work that we have done over the last six to nine months has been magnificent, in terms of moving on speed.
"
Person1,"But there is more that we can do; there's always more that we can do.
"
Person1,"And we're clearly focused on that.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"This concludes our call for today.
"
Person1,"Thank you for joining us this morning, and for your ongoing interest in Express.
"
Person1,"Please accept my best wishes for the holiday season.
