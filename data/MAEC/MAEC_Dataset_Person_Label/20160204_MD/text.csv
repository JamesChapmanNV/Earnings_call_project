"
Person2,"Good morning.

Person2,"Yes, it's not really material to speak of.

Person2,"Again, most of the increase that you see as a percentage and in dollars is just rolling in the portfolio of companies because they have a different classification of expenses.

"
Person2,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"Well, if there are no further questions, then I thank you for participating this morning, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you, operator.
