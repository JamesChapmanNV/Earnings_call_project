Person1,"Think I mentioned earlier about 73 million shares, just slightly above it.
"
Person1,"You will see that when we file our Q.
"
Person1,"Actually that will be in the schedule mentioned as the weighted average number.
"
Person1,"We continue to implement that program.
"
Person1,"It's a three-year program.
"
Person1,"No update at this point.
"
Person1,"I gave you the update during my script.
"
Person1,"That's, basically, we're halfway through the program and have another 50 million it to go.
"
Person0,"We made an announcement when we announced the program, which was early this year or late last year, so I don't know exactly the time frame, and since that we have bought back $50 million worth of shares.
"
Person0,"This is an ongoing program that is going to keep going for the next $50 million that we still have.
"
Person1,"We'll give you an update during the next earnings call for this current quarter.
"
Person1,"That is right.
"
Person1,"We only guide to the revenue, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"As you know we do internal focus to maintain 45% growth margin.
"
Person1,"So everything we do we try to actually keep it above that.
"
Person1,"That's a great question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I think the fact that we are driving off our customers' CapEx budget, you know the timing can shift.
"
Person1,"Sometimes actual utilizations are up in the 85% they can still delay it.
"
Person1,"So it is hard to predict and forecast when they're going to actually invest in new equipment.
"
Person0,"Typically as a rule of thumb, if our customers' utilization is above 85%, they start to increase their CapEx, okay.
"
Person0,"Because in the OSAT world when you run your factory at 90% you are essentially full, as you need about 10% capacity freedom to be able to move the parts within your factory to keep some flexibility.
"
Person0,"If it's a technology move like we have seen, for instance, for copper, it's a totally different story.
"
Person0,"Then you may see capacity or capital expenditure done in a way which is not linked to utilization or cyclicality because it's just the new technology that they want and that they will need because it's a customer requirement.
"
Person0,"In this case you will just see that purchase of that technology be done when they need it.
"
Person0,"So there are two scenarios.
"
Person0,"You're welcome.
