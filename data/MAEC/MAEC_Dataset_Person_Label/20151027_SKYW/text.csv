Person0,"I would tell you that the dynamic has certainly evolved over the last 24 months to where I would say today the majority of our conversation is retaining the 50-seat fleet that we have, you know.
"
Person0,"As <UNK> pointed out in the last 15 to 18 months we've pulled out a lot of 50 seaters but that's, you know, I think in my view, in our view and strategy, turning the [corner] where we see significant demand on our entire fleets and the products at both airlines.
"
Person0,"So we are seeing a little bit of that dynamic change and we're strategically aligning ourselves to make sure that we work with our partners to deliver what they want within that fleet.
"
Person1,"Sure, well I think <UNK>, as we said, that 2016 is the year for kind of positioning ourselves to take maximum advantage of the growth and profitable flying that's out there.
"
Person1,"So, I think that as we look at 2016 as that transition year, I think from a margin standpoint, again, as <UNK> sort of intimated we've got fleet renewal opportunities that represent potential upside to our model out there but I think if you look at kind of our base scenario that that's something that's achievable just with the core strategy that we've been articulating for some time that we're going to continue to shrink the unprofitable flying as much as possible and we're going to, you know, add accretive new planes to our mix as the opportunity provides itself.
"
Person1,"So, obviously with respect to our delivery schedules, most of those deliveries begin in earnest in mid-2016 and run really primarily through the four-quarter period comprising the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017; that's when the bulk of that flying is going to be -- you know, the new flying will come online so margins will be correlated with the timing of the new airlines or the new aircraft as well as the timing of any and all fleet kind of renewal discussions that we're able to successfully booked in the upcoming year.
"
Person1,"So I think margin improvement is definitely part of our core strategy with, again, some potential upside out there based on conversations with our partners.
"
Person0,"Yeah, so as you look at Q3 there are definitely some aircraft that were added into the system that should continue on for the next foreseeable future honestly.
"
Person0,"So, we anticipate some of these aircraft to continue on.
"
Person0,"There were no current contracts that got improved during the quarter.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you [Andrew].
"
Person0,"Again, we really appreciate your interest in SkyWest Inc.
"
Person0,", and more importantly it's certainly humbling to represent the 20th professionals at both airlines that work hard to continue to make our progress.
"
Person0,"I think as you can hear from our dialogue today we had a great quarter.
"
Person0,"We're optimistic about our future.
"
Person0,"We have a clear plan in place and it's going to take a lot of work from a lot of parties but we feel like we've got some very good objectives out there for the next year and beyond to continue to make improvements.
"
Person0,"With that we'll give our thanks and end the call.
"
Person0,"Back to you [Andrew].
