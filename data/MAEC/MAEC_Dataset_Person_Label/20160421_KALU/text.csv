Person1,"I would say the entire change that you see in price per pound, fourth quarter to first quarter, almost all of it would've been mix related to the long products change.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"I wouldn't go there, but most of the new product launches that we have this year are bumper programs.
"
Person1,"So, as the car companies replace one platform with a new platform, we'll typically be involved there.
"
Person1,"In some of those the old platforms they are replacing may have been steel bumpers and now they are moving over to aluminum bumpers.
"
Person1,"But it's just the general migration that we've seen over the past several years of growth in bumpers.
"
Person1,"Although the really rapid growth here is for bumpers were probably five years ago, and that growth has tapered off some, but continues, and we expect it to continue, at a reasonable growth rate.
"
Person1,"But not double-digit growth rate like we were seeing a few years ago.
"
Person1,"I'm sorry, which was that.
"
Person2,"Value added revenue quarterly.
"
Person2,"And seasonality (multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"Oh, quarterly value added revenue.
"
Person1,"Again, that's a question I'm glad you asked.
"
Person1,"The first quarter in any year is almost like the fourth quarter; it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"Our typical pattern is the first quarter is strong, the second quarter is stronger, then we taper off in the third quarter and the fourth quarter is the worst quarter.
"
Person1,"However, what happens in the fourth quarter -- and coincidentally, what happens in the first quarter -- is often a function of what customers are doing with their inventories at the end of the year.
"
Person1,"So, we got hit pretty hard in the aerospace long products in the fourth quarter, as we said.
"
Person1,"It's rebounded here in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"What we can measure, however, is when we look at our total first quarter, how much of the strong value added revenue that we had was a function of other customer activities at year end that might've been under our radar screen because we were so preoccupied with what was going on in long products.
"
Person1,"So, this year we don't expect to see a significant increase like we normally do in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, but we still expect the typical longer-term seasonal pattern, which is a strong first half and the weaker second half.
"
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person2,"During the quarter I believe the number is about 83,000 shares that we purchased.
"
Person2,"It was about $6.4 million that we spent during the quarter.
"
Person2,"And we have a lot of room still on the existing plan.
"
Person2,"I think it's $117 million as of the end of the quarter, I believe that's authorized, yet to be purchased -- for purchase by the Board.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call.
"
Person1,"We've got a nice start to the year and we look forward to updating you again in the second quarter call in July.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
