Person1,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Like I said, it's as Dave said, you have some multifamily, you have some hotels, you have some office, you have some retail, you have some municipal projects that are lumped in there.
"
Person1,"The one area that's probably not real active is single family lot development, which we're not seeing a lot of that activity right now.
"
Person1,"We do have some churn.
"
Person1,"I mean, as projects near completion, then they roll into your other bucket, or get financed out.
"
Person1,"So you'll see some ins and outs in that portfolio.
"
Person1,"On a linked-quarter, that C&I portfolio was essentially flat.
"
Person1,"And there's some seasonality in there too.
"
Person1,"I mean, you'll usually -- the fourth quarter and first quarter are a little slower than your second and third, just for timing and everything.
"
Person1,"There was not anything in the NPA bucket that was directly tied to the oil and gas.
"
Person1,"And matter of fact, some of it was just expected clean-up on some of the acquired portfolio out east.
"
Person1,"And then, we had a C&I credit out in one of the Ohio markets that just was due to some unforeseen circumstances, just kind of got sideways.
"
Person1,"But it was nothing related to oil and gas.
"
Person1,"Now that being said, it's something that we're watching.
"
Person1,"There's been a couple of companies that have laid off in the area.
"
Person1,"You just look at, rig counts are down.
"
Person1,"I think at the peak, they were about 125, just looking at statistics a couple weeks ago.
"
Person1,"And last year about this time, there were maybe 55 rigs, and now there's 29 in Pennsylvania.
"
Person1,"So it's going to have some pressure on some of the supply chain.
"
Person1,"But production's up.
"
Person1,"It's up to about 20 billion cubic feet a day, I think in the region is the last number I heard.
"
Person1,"But the issue still is, getting it to market and the pipeline.
"
Person1,"I think capacity is maybe half of that.
"
Person1,"Now they anticipate that kind of equalizing about this time next year.
"
Person1,"So they'll at least be able to get what they can produce to market.
"
Person1,"And then, probably in 2017 to maybe 2018, that number goes up.
"
Person1,"So you can start to be kind of a net exporter on the resource.
"
Person1,"But that being said too, there's a lot, a lot of activity in the region.
"
Person1,"It appears that the Shell is still moving forward with their big project out in Beaver.
"
Person1,"We've seen clients that are getting inquiries from a lot of petrochemical type companies, or end users of the products or manufacturing concerns that can be right on top of a cheap energy source.
"
Person1,"So even though there might be a little bit of a slowdown for the next year or so, long-term, it's going to be just really, really good for the region so.
"
Person1,"It's kind of tough to measure too on -- when you're going into the local gas station in the morning, you used to see a few more bodies around from the service company guys.
"
Person1,"And so, the impact on those types of businesses or hotels or whatever, still not showing up in the numbers yet.
"
Person1,"But again, it's just something we're probably going to take a look at.
"
Person1,"Dave or <UNK>, you're welcome to weigh in too.
"
Person1,"Our portfolio kind of indirectly tied into it is about $[50] million, and the average risk weightings are about 3.5[%].
"
Person1,"So mostly, pretty clean today.
"
Person0,"They do have a lot of ties to the energy sector.
"
Person0,"So they've had some customer losses related to that.
"
Person1,"There's been some consolidation.
"
Person1,"I mean, they get couple clients who got sold.
"
Person1,"To bigger entities.
"
Person1,"And then they -- some is tied in, some workers' comp customers, and kind of the shrinking payroll and this stuff is impacting premiums as well.
"
Person0,"Well, on a monthly or quarterly basis, that's going to impact -- certainly not the whole portfolio.
"
Person0,"It might be maybe $200 million to $300 million of the -- or not even that much, maybe $200 million of the whole portfolio.
"
Person0,"So it's a slow -- it's a slower (multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, I don't believe anything is on a SNC in the portfolio.
"
Person0,"I would probably -- maybe a little over half, I would say.
"
Person0,"Okay, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I want to thank everybody for participating in today's call.
"
Person1,"And <UNK> and Dave and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the quarter's results, and look forward to hearing from you in our next conference call in January.
"
Person1,"So thank you very much.
"
