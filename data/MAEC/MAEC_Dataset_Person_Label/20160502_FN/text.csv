Person,Sentence
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I think, <UNK>, your date of December is really in line with what we plan and what we anticipate.
"
Person1,"Yes, so we don't break out that but in the past we've said most of the startup cost is in operating expense.
"
Person1,"So in the past quarter of Q3, we still look at about $2 million to $2.5 million baked into the operating expense.
"
Person1,"Now, bear in mind that $2.5 million has about $0.5 million sales and marketing, which rightfully belongs below the line.
"
Person1,"So I am hopeful that when you get to the breakeven level that $2 million will be fully absorbed into the cost of goods sold.
"
Person0,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"As we look at it, we don't see any one-off.
"
Person0,"Most -- every one of our Japanese customers today, which we are certainly proud of, is a continued customer with the Company.
"
Person0,"I think -- that's absolutely correct.
"
Person0,"We are experiencing increased experience in the Japanese outsourcing.
"
Person0,"Our sales efforts and engineering effort in Japan are quite successful.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I think during the timeframe of OFC we had this scare of ZTE.
"
Person1,"I believe it's completely behind us right now.
"
Person1,"Most everybody is resuming shipping to ZTE.
"
Person1,"So far from our vantage point, I don't see any impact after the big scare.
"
Person1,"But in terms of Verizon strike, so far again we have not seen any impact.
"
Person1,"In the future, I don't know.
"
Person1,"If there's an impact, I don't think it's going to slow down the metro upgrade, maybe it's just a message of delay a little bit in terms of timing.
"
Person1,"But so far, Fabrinet has not seen any impact on that.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"For this quarter, there is really very little, in fact, almost none.
"
Person1,"There is a mark-to-market gain -- we excluded it from the non-GAAP reporting.
"
Person1,"There's something about interest expense, how we offset interest income expense.
"
Person1,"We have a flood income.
"
Person1,"We, again, excluded this from the non-GAAP.
"
Person1,"So from a non-GAAP standpoint, other income expense, I would say, is insignificant.
"
Person1,"A little bit, not a lot.
"
Person1,"Again, we will continue to see that -- I won't call it SG&A, I said operating expense, will be continuing to decline.
"
Person1,"A lot depends on how fast Fabrinet West performs.
"
Person1,"But if that gets to breakeven then, yes, that $10 million will be significantly lower.
"
Person1,"On the 10% customer, no, we haven't said anything yet because we normally report once a year.
"
Person1,"So next quarter, I will have a report who will be the new 10% customer for this year.
"
Person1,"We are ramping a few customers.
"
Person1,"Honestly, until the last finishing line, I really cannot tell who will be the winner.
"
Person0,"We always had the end of September, as the opening of that facility.
"
Person0,"That in fact is going to happen.
"
Person0,"As <UNK> said, we fully expect that we will be shipping product out of there in the third quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Typically, new business as we've discussed before, will come in a little bit higher than gross margin because we have room to improve the yield and so on and with the improvement we share with the customer.
"
Person1,"So I think for competitors, like existing product, existing customers, new business generates a little bit higher than the gross margin.
"
Person1,"Contract you mean.
"
Person0,"A little bit of background on that.
"
Person0,"Our customer base is not based on a contract, it's based on a volume supply agreement.
"
Person0,"A volume supply agreement really is what the customer and ourselves agree on is how we're going to run the business between the two of us.
"
Person0,"It's really not project -- in fact it is not project defined, it includes a relationship.
"
Person0,"Beyond that, it's all a relationship.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So in terms of volume -- as you know, the gross margin pretty much depends on the volume .
"
Person1,"it's volume driven.
"
Person1,"The higher the volume, obviously we get better absorption.
"
Person1,"Again, in terms of volume, we only have 13-week visibility.
"
Person1,"So beyond 13-weeks, it's pretty cloudy.
"
Person1,"Until I know the volume, I really cannot project gross margin.
"
Person1,"But we do know that we have pressures on labor costs, obviously you understand that.
"
Person1,"We continue to find offsets and the offsets to -- productivity and to material pricing and so on.
"
Person1,"Cost reduction is an ongoing thing in a factory.
"
Person1,"So I feel the 12% to 12.5% we guided to all along is achievable.
"
Person1,"We're comfortable with that level.
"
Person1,"Beyond that, it all depends on the volume.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I don't know that they enjoy it, but we are ramping QSFP28 also as I mentioned in the prepared remarks.
"
Person1,"So 100-gig is the main driver, obviously silicon photonics is also ramping nicely, all the advanced components to support 100-gig.
"
Person1,"So those are the products we see as pretty strong.
"
Person1,"A lot of these are in the telecom in the past quarter or so.
"
Person1,"We see strong demand there.
"
Person1,"Again, for the specifics probably if you ask our customer, you might get better insight.
"
Person1,"But yes, you are right, we see pretty strong demand there.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"I don't know, <UNK>, did you see any impact there.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"We can really tell you that we have seen absolutely no effect with that strike.
"
Person0,"No, I think across the board, I think we were able to rise to the occasion and ship as requested throughout the whole quarter.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, we don't go into that much detail.
"
Person1,"The only thing I can tell you is that in silicon photonics today, I think I have mentioned this before, it's increasing as a percent of revenue.
"
Person1,"Today it's already surpassed 15%.
"
Person1,"That's all I can tell you.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"You are going to see tomorrow when we file the Q, essentially, we shipped more to North America in the past quarter than any other region.
"
Person1,"So that's in the Q.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"Let me try my best to answer that.
"
Person1,"I think if you look at both segments, telecom and datacom, both are growing -- continuing to grow.
"
Person1,"Obviously, telecom is accelerating, the growth is accelerating like we expected.
"
Person1,"So again, in the case of telecom -- a lot of that comes from existing customer, the legacy product, because they support the telecom growth.
"
Person1,"So some of what you mentioned, the ROADM, amplifiers and so on.
"
Person1,"Those are supporting, the TC -- telecom upgrade and you can see it, we're in the cycle right now.
"
Person1,"We are in the upgrade cycle right now.
"
Person1,"Now, we see pretty good momentum too, even though datacom has been growing tremendously in the last couple of quarters, we see the momentum continuing.
"
Person1,"So, like I said, telecom comes to the party and continues to accelerate.
"
Person1,"That's all I can tell you.
"
Person1,"And the new business, some of which are supporting both segments, too.
"
Person1,"So we achieved multiple growth from all segments.
"
Person1,"Is that helpful.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"So for the ops com versus non-ops com, I would expect that the ratio will probably continue.
"
Person1,"We saw a nice growth 77% this past quarter on optical communications, and non-optical at 33%.
"
Person1,"I believe the same pattern will probably be maintained in the next quarter.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"Within ops com, I would expect telecom will inch up a little bit compared to datacom.
"
Person1,"So next quarter, I believe that telecom -- I would expect telecom to be a little bit higher than, in terms of percentage, higher than the past quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, the one thing that we've never experienced in the industry is the price movement because of a shortage of capacity.
"
Person0,"But in this case, pricing has never been a factor.
"
Person0,"What we are experiencing is the capacity constraints that exist are primarily capacity constraints on equipment that's furnished or owned by the customer.
"
Person0,"So their capital layout only carries to a certain capacity.
"
Person0,"The capacity constraints are not the constraints of the facilities, bricks and mortar, or headcount or those types of issues.
"
Person0,"Considering, as you well know, we believe we're in the early part of this ramping cycle.
"
Person0,"A ramping cycle does have capacity constraints as it moves forward.
"
Person0,"Well, we have the floor space of about 500,000 square feet.
"
Person0,"We certainly have made some commitments to that square footage, but I really can't go through and define -- divulge who it has been made to.
"
Person0,"Back to your other question on -- I think the industry, as we go through this ramping period, which obviously is very good for everybody, is arising to the occasion to meet the demand.
"
Person0,"There are isolated cases of capacity problems, which obviously are resolved in a short period of time.
"
Person0,"What our experience is, and we have experienced it over about the last 15, 16 years, is that it takes us for a new facility -- and that's the largest facility we put in -- the balance of the others were about 300,000 square feet -- it takes us about three years to complete the assignment of all the space.
"
Person0,"And obviously about halfway through that, we start another building.
"
Person0,"But it is certainly, we certainly have a lot of space to be allocated in the 500,000 square feet.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We want to say thanks for joining the call.
"
Person0,"Have a good evening.
