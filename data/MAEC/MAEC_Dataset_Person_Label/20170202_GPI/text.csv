Person1,"You're welcome.
"
Person1,"Well, I don't know that I can articulate in great detail versus some of the independents, but the factor that we have in our company is that 26% of our business comes from Toyota or Lexus brand franchises.
"
Person1,"And these are car-driven franchises.
"
Person1,"And to keep that machine running, we take a lot of car trade-ins.
"
Person1,"And cars have been hit the hardest on used vehicle values, and we have to keep taking those to make the new car sales.
"
Person1,"So that's one of the challenges that we need to overcome.
"
Person1,"But that said, I would think there is still opportunity for us to have a bit more discipline and do a better job than we have in the past.
"
Person1,"I would say we're quite open on brands as we look to grow externally.
"
Person1,"And everybody would like luxury brands and so forth, but we have had success with virtually all brands.
"
Person1,"And so it's just a function of geography and return on investment.
"
Person1,"So I would say we're as open as we've ever been on brand.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"At this point -- we did our offering in December 2015.
"
Person2,"We are very actively capitalized.
"
Person2,"We have plenty of dry powder, so there is really no need for that at this point.
"
Person2,"Yes, I think that's a good explanation.
"
Person2,"The team has done a good job of making those trades.
"
Person1,"Well, I do think it dictates that they will be tweaking up their incentive tactics or strategy a bit.
"
Person1,"But we have to remember, leasing is very regionalized within the US -- Northeast, and California and Florida come to mind.
"
Person1,"So, in many cases, they can deal with that on a regional basis, I think.
"
Person1,"But I do believe that most of these companies that have done a lot of leasing, most of these brands, are going to be making some adjustments.
"
Person1,"And there will be funds flowing into non-lease tactics.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, this is <UNK> <UNK>el.
"
Person2,"I mean, we have an internet presence today, and we do do some direct sales.
"
Person2,"We use multiple channels, whether it's our internet, whether it's eBay Motors.
"
Person2,"So, we are doing some of that today.
"
Person2,"We have the capability of doing basically online sales.
"
Person1,"Well, I would say there is an assumption of a slight decline in retail.
"
Person0,"Yes, it is obviously less impactful on a global basis because you have less, but on a new vehicle, we are basically 62 days on a global basis.
"
Person1,"Yes, you're correct, that is not material.
"
Person1,"But it is, I think, 400 new and 450 used units.
"
Person1,"So in the overall scheme of things, irritating but not material.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
"
Person1,"We look forward to updating you on our first quarter earnings call in April.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
