Person1,"So in terms of materials processing, as I mentioned already in the prepared remarks, we saw a lot of activity across a lot of applications.
"
Person1,"In general, this is new capabilities that are being delivered into the market.
"
Person1,"And I would say some of it is also due to renewed focus on the part of our new team members in Europe.
"
Person1,"If you look at the traditional applications, the bread-and-butter applications, they are doing okay.
"
Person1,"It is a lot of these advanced applications that are really driving the business, where the value add for the laser tool is quite high.
"
Person2,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, thanks for your question.
"
Person2,"No change.
"
Person2,"We did announce $30 million of synergies on the November 9 call, post the transaction.
"
Person2,"We announced a number of actions that represented about 80% of that $30 million number, in terms of skewing between the restructuring costs or the costs associated with obtaining those synergies.
"
Person2,"As you said and I will echo again, they are front-loaded, with synergies coming later on.
"
Person2,"So no change in that overall perspective.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"We have seen some positive trends in all three markets, but for different sub-markets.
"
Person1,"In China, there has obviously been a lot of investment around the EMS supply chain, whether it is for advanced products like ELA, or some of these ultra-fast products, to cutting and marking lasers.
"
Person1,"So a lot of activity in China for the EMS.
"
Person1,"In Europe, we've seen some good work around component technologies that feed the materials processing market.
"
Person1,"And in the US, it has been a combination of automotive and medical device manufacturing.
"
Person1,"So while collectively, there has been a lot of positive movement, it is geographically specific in terms of activities.
"
Person1,"I'm sorry, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We actually have a pretty substantial business where we sell laser components to other companies that manufacture either lasers or systems.
"
Person1,"And these can be diodes, fibers, connectors, other things.
"
Person1,"That business has actually been quite strong in Europe.
"
Person1,"The majority of them are exported, and probably much of is going to China.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, if you recall, again, I think was last quarter or the quarter before, we talked about the fact that, with some very nominal investments, particularly around optics fabrication, that we could increase output from -- the customer here is an important one to us in the industry.
"
Person1,"So we've made that accommodation.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Emily.
"
Person1,"I want to thank everyone for their participation today.
"
Person1,"Obviously we are very excited about the results, more excited about the future.
"
Person1,"We look forward to talking to you in a few months.
