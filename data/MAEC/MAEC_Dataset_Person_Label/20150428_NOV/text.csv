Person0,"(Laughter) Not much of which I can answer, or will answer very quantitatively.
"
Person0,"We maximize returns by trying to minimize capital going into these opportunities.
"
Person0,"We are a veteran of many, many, many transactions.
"
Person0,"We've done this many times before and built up global-leading franchises around the world, across pretty much all that we do.
"
Person0,"We're number one in just about everything that we do.
"
Person0,"And that's very central to our strategy.
"
Person0,"And so in terms of what comes available, not just out of the big red/blue merger we've all been talking about, but more broadly, what's out there, what's possible.
"
Person0,"We're always looking at opportunities.
"
Person0,"But the cornerstone of that effort really resides in market leadership.
"
Person0,"We've been very clear.
"
Person0,"We think market leadership carries demonstrable competitive all advantage in this space.
"
Person0,"We think we reduce risk for our customers by being market leader.
"
Person0,"We think scale gets us up learning curves faster.
"
Person0,"It support broader global networks to deliver products and services and equipment.
"
Person0,"Let's us leverage R&D efforts and introduce new products more quickly.
"
Person0,"For lots of reasons market leadership carries lower risk and higher returns.
"
Person0,"And so that's pretty central to what we do when we evaluate opportunities to deploy capital, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, that's the key thing, what you said last.
"
Person0,"We need sellers to reset expectations.
"
Person0,"And so we're helping them do that.
"
Person0,"[All right], <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Good morning
"
Person0,"I'm going to be a little cryptic around that because I don't really want to tell my competitors my playbook.
"
Person0,"But what I would say is again, we're focused on big picture trends in the industry, market leadership and competitive advantage.
"
Person0,"And looking to deploy capital into those areas more broadly.
"
Person0,"I will tell you specifically where we've been deploying capital the last couple of years has really enhanced our aftermarket in particular around rig.
"
Person0,"The rising installed base of NOV equipment and technology out there is pretty transparent to you and everybody.
"
Person0,"And so what we see are a lot more NOV rigs running and a lot more customers in need of close OEM support.
"
Person0,"And what we find is that these great little businesses that we can acquire.
"
Person0,"In fact, two weeks ago I was touring one that we bought in West Africa, for instance, South Africa.
"
Person0,"It's been a great addition and great reputation, and what we've been able to bring to that business is kind of the NOV global reach and scale.
"
Person0,"And so that's been a great help for our customers in that region.
"
Person0,"But around the world, all of our customers want us to be closer to the coal face, closer to their rigs for aftermarket support.
"
Person0,"So that's an interesting area.
"
Person0,"And that's part of the reason at our Analyst Day we said, growth prospects for rig aftermarket long term are terrific, and we're putting capital behind that.
"
Person0,"In other businesses, again we have opportunities to grow those, expand their footprint and so kind of a similar pattern.
"
Person0,"We're always kind of reevaluating our business model, and does it make sense.
"
Person0,"And frankly, there's already some level of competition within that business.
"
Person0,"And that's very common across oilfield services.
"
Person0,"It's not uncommon for competitors to sell to each other in one product line and compete on another.
"
Person0,"And so -- but we think about that very closely.
"
Person0,"We don't want to unnecessarily end up in a competitive conflict situation that really takes a toll on our P&L.
"
Person0,"So I'll leave it there.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thanks, Brandon.
"
Person0,"I appreciate everyone's patience this morning and apologies for the technical difficulties that we started off with.
"
Person0,"I really also want to thank our terrific employees for the hard work that they all put in here every day.
"
Person0,"And although we have a pretty challenging road ahead, we're adapting quickly.
"
Person0,"We have lots of opportunities emerging to launch new products and to acquire some pretty interesting businesses, and really position ourselves for the upturn.
"
Person0,"So we're doing what we got to do in the short term, looking through that for opportunities in the long term.
"
Person0,"And I know we will emerge better and stronger.
"
Person0,"And again, thank you all for joining us.
"
Person0,"We look forward to updating you in July.
"
