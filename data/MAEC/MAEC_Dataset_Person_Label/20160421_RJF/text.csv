Person3,"Sure, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"The outstanding balance of March 31 in the energy portfolio is $451 million.
"
Person3,"That's, once again, 32 borrowers.
"
Person3,"Our total commitments came down by $28 million on the quarter, and now the total commitments is $742 million.
"
Person3,"So the difference there is the amount of unfunded commitments.
"
Person2,"I don't think anyone is fully reserved if oil stays low for a long period of time.
"
Person2,"There are certainly companies that are leveraged or asset-rich, who are using cash or other things, are going to struggle.
"
Person2,"I'd say if we have sustained oil prices at this level, there will be additions to reserves.
"
Person2,"First, you are allowed to pitch for 401(k) rollover business.
"
Person2,"You fall into the BIC and you enter into a [fiduciary] position that you have to be giving that advice to roll over in the best interest of the clients.
"
Person2,"If you look at most of the standards, it says, you about can do anything as long as it is in the best of the clients.
"
Person2,"And be ready to prove you did.
"
Person2,"That's really what the rule over-boiled-down says.
"
Person2,"Certainly it has been an area of 401(k)s because people do retire and want it managed and roll over.
"
Person2,"I don't know if it is a huge percentage of our business -- I could not give a percentage, but certainly it has been a part of everybody's business.
"
Person2,"I don't think it will go away if the standard is raised.
"
Person2,"The standard is to make sure what is good for the client is fine.
"
Person2,"There's nothing wrong with that.
"
Person2,"That should be the standard.
"
Person2,"I think the DOL, in their historic position, had, had a bias saying that it generally was not the best interest of the client.
"
Person2,"I think the new rule basically says, we're not trying to force the lowest fee platforms, but just make sure you're recommending what's in their best interest.
"
Person2,"So any time a person goes from not having a fee to having a fee, you can argue, they are biased.
"
Person2,"I just think you have to prove that it's a reasonable recommendation in looking at the client.
"
Person2,"And so it will continue.
"
Person2,"I think there may be more liability associated with it.
"
Person2,"Certainly more documentation, which a lot of these costs are going to be in process and documentation.
"
Person4,"I think that's the potential outcome.
"
Person4,"And frankly, we like that there are independent firms in the industry.
"
Person4,"We don't want to be the only non-big bank-owned firm.
"
Person4,"We look at our cost, and certainly any type of layer of layer of regulation really increases costs, especially if you cross $1 billion.
"
Person4,"And then you cross $50 billion, you get another level.
"
Person4,"Certainly, it's tough on the industry and tough on players when you have this much regulatory costs.
"
Person4,"We feel it, and I'm sure our friends and competitors, but friendly competitors in the other firms who share our similar values, it's got to be tougher on them.
"
Person4,"We're not hoping regulation drives them out of business.
"
Person4,"But if they make the determination that it's too costly and they want to join someone who is of like-minded culture for those firms, we would welcome them.
"
Person4,"I'm not sure that's a good result for the industry.
"
Person1,"We actually expect ours to be slightly down from where they are.
"
Person1,"The mega banks are going to be the ones that feel it a little more than us.
"
Person1,"We will get the full step down, then partially back up because of our size.
"
Person1,"So we actually expect ours to drop, but not materially.
"
Person2,"It will be a small number.
"
Person1,"A basis point or fraction thereof.
"
Person1,"Correct.
"
Person1,"Great.
"
Person1,"Thank you all very much.
"
Person1,"I know you had a lot of questions so we wanted to allow the time.
"
Person1,"Most importantly, last quarter, I know people thought was a little weaker and this quarter a little stronger.
"
Person1,"But what we focus on is long term.
"
Person1,"And as I said the end of last quarter, that all of the indicators and recruitment assets were positive.
"
Person1,"I feel the same thing about this quarter.
"
Person1,"I'm not going to take [over believe] this is a long-term business, and the good news is our forward indicators are positive.
"
Person1,"We have a great team of people here working hard and we have to earn it every quarter.
"
Person1,"I appreciate your time and interest this morning.
"
Person1,"We will talk in three months.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
