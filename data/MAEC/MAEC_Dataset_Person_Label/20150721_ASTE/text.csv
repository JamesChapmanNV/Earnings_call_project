Person1,"Yes and we did that measure.
"
Person1,"And for the quarter, it's about $4.5 million on the revenue line.
"
Person1,"For the backlog, it hurt us about $4 million as well.
"
Person2,"Remembering that we were slow to that, pretty slow, I mean the last few years is when we really started to focus on it.
"
Person2,"But if a score of 100% would be the end of the journey, which I don't know if you are ever at the end of the lean journey, based on where we are today, but if 100% was that, I still think we are not, I don't know, I guess halfway to 60%.
"
Person2,"I mean we've got a lot still that we can do and improve our factories and our office operations.
"
Person2,"It's just not in the factories.
"
Person2,"So that's just without having done a lot of -- that's a gut feel from being in the plants and talking with our guys and looking at our rankings and the things we're working on.
"
Person2,"I think we would be in the 25%-plus range.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"We've got over 220 product lines.
"
Person2,"But by group, I would tell you that we have, in most cases, held onto market share.
"
Person2,"And in a few cases, we have gained market share, and where we have slight market share loss would be probably in the highway pavers, but not by much.
"
Person2,"We've gained enough that it was -- we've lost a little, but we haven't really lost a lot.
"
Person2,"And part of that is there has been a lot of rent-to-own in the last selling season.
"
Person2,"But again, Roadtec is doing really pretty well through the first half.
"
Person2,"So it's hard to get to critical on Roadtec on that.
"
Person2,"But if there was one place where I'd say we have lost any, and it wouldn't be much, that would probably be where it is.
"
Person2,"Everywhere else we've done a fine job of holding onto market share.
"
Person2,"It's frustrating walking around up there, to be honest.
"
Person2,"I would say that there are those that get it and understand it.
"
Person2,"But sometimes you try to hold your patience, but at one of the meetings, I said to -- well, I shouldn't say what I said to them -- but I just said it's easy to sit here in D.
"
Person2,"C.
"
Person2,"where you fix the roads for the tourists and not know what district they were from and how good the contractor was in their district.
"
Person2,"And I said it's easy to fly back and forth between those two areas where you've got a great contractor and great roads and then back to D.
"
Person2,", I said.
"
Person2,"But I've been to 16 states in the first half of the year, and I can tell you it's falling apart.
"
Person2,"And I just don't know that they get that.
"
Person2,"Now, I do think that the majority of them understand they need to do something.
"
Person2,"I do think they've gotten the messages.
"
Person2,"I think our associations have done a great job of giving them those stats, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I really do.
"
Person2,"I think most of them get it.
"
Person2,"That was a one-off, and I'm sorry I was emotional about that.
"
Person2,"But I do think they know they need to do it.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I would say that Texas would be one of those states.
"
Person2,"Florida would be one of those states.
"
Person2,"Oklahoma has been okay for some of our customers.
"
Person2,"So those would be the ones that would come to mind just talking here on the phone.
"
Person2,"At this point, I would say it is not dozens but dozen, 12 to 15 right now.
"
Person2,"It depends on where that business comes into, <UNK>, by division, but I would say probably in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range.
"
Person2,"We can handle a lot of work up to that.
"
Person2,"That being said, I would tell you our utilization would sound better than that right now, but we are not working three shifts in every place.
"
Person2,"So I mean we could add shifts and add people, and our ability to get people is fairly good in most locations.
"
Person2,"We have some where the unemployment is still really low, but by and large I think we could get good people to be able to go up in the $1.5 billion range pretty quickly.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, I think we might have seen a little bit of that through the buying season this year because it was just a little more stable.
"
Person2,"It wasn't much, but it feels a little more stable.
"
Person2,"There's people still looking on the plant side right now.
"
Person2,"So I would think we might be seeing that on a small scale right now because the plants have been running a little more in the last year.
"
Person2,"So I think we may be seeing that just a little bit.
"
Person2,"I don't know that that wouldn't be an end of 2016, the 2016-2017 type buying season event more than a this year event.
"
Person2,"I think we will always probably have -- I think the larger divisions -- let me back up.
"
Person2,"The larger ones, by and large, are pretty close to all having new systems that will be good for a decade or more.
"
Person2,"And then some of the smaller divisions may do them, but they will be much smaller in price, too, because there's less users.
"
Person2,"So we are also having everybody choose one of two systems, so we are getting more continuity across the board.
"
Person2,"And we are getting better at putting them in, and that helps us.
"
Person2,"We are doing a little best practice, more best practices sharing.
"
Person2,"So I think we're going to be seeing that come down probably after next year pretty significantly.
"
Person3,"This is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person3,"There is definitely some surplus equipment available right now, rigs and pumpers.
"
Person3,"It would probably take several months of sustained increases in the prices to try to use up some of that inventory.
"
Person3,"But after that, I think we have a good chance of selling some new equipment in those areas.
"
Person2,"Thank you, Adam.
"
Person2,"We appreciate everyone's participation on our second-quarter conference call.
"
Person2,"Thank you for your interest in Astec.
"
Person2,"As our news release indicates, today's conference call has been recorded.
"
Person2,"A replay of the conference call will be available through August 4, 2015, and an archived webcast will be available for 90 days.
"
Person2,"A transcript will be available under the Investor Relations section of the Astec Industries website within the next seven days.
"
Person2,"All of that information is contained in the news release that was sent out earlier today.
"
Person2,"So this concludes our call.
"
Person2,"Thank you all.
"
Person2,"Have a good week.
"
