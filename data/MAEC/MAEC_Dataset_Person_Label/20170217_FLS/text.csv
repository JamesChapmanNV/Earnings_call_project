Person1,"It's a really good question because you think in terms of technology within our manufacturing capability.
"
Person1,"For those of you who joined us in Raleigh a couple years ago, you saw some sophisticated computerized machinery and why is that important.
"
Person1,"Well, one, because if you think about the precision around the process conditions and the engineering drawings and the castings, much higher level of precision, less scrap, more efficiency, better tolerances.
"
Person1,"I think the other thing is, if you look at the labor associated with that, the labor force is changing.
"
Person1,"We still have some, fewer than we did before, but we have some old vertical and horizontal lathes in our plant and that is an art and the individual has been doing it for 30 or 40 years and the chance for error is higher.
"
Person1,"So, yes, in our facilities that we've been standing up, we have much more efficient computerized machinery that's doing a lot of the manufacturing for us.
"
Person1,"If you are talking about technology within our product, absolutely and we always maintain the product matters because that's where the process conditions are determined.
"
Person1,"That's where the algorithms are created from.
"
Person1,"That's where you can put the sensors in.
"
Person1,"It is really the intelligence of the operation that passes along to a DCS, a system.
"
Person1,"So on both ends, technology has been very important and it will help us both in manufacturing and in selling our products.
"
Person1,"The last extension is just using technology in terms of computers to sell to customers.
"
Person1,"Increasingly, now, especially on the run rate business, customers want to be able to go online, configure the product, order it and our commercial organization and sales organization have been working very hard.
"
Person1,"The big beneficiary when we get in that place is going to be IPD.
"
Person1,"Yes, to my comment earlier, I don't want to give any quarterly guidance and we talked earlier in terms of what exit margins could be.
"
Person1,"I will go back to, in the IPD business, we still think that that is a business that should be at 14% to 15% levels.
"
Person1,"How and when we get there, obviously if the market were to ramp up quickly over the next quarter, that's going to help you, but in terms of operationally, we have certainly turned the corner, but not completely in terms of improving the business and bringing it back to the levels it should, keeping in mind that two of our most profitable largest revenue plants were impacted, as <UNK> described.
"
Person1,"So I think around expectations, it's getting those processes in place, but let's pull the market aside at this point in time continuing to improve that, winning back our customers, which will help top line absent a market, driving more efficiency.
"
Person1,"When a plant gets choked, it can become -- it impacts margins dramatically.
"
Person1,"So I think I just want to give you some context and -- but I will take a step back moment -- the person who is doing this has done this before and with great success and that's <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Not really.
"
Person1,"If you look at some of the equipment that we operate, it's fairly sophisticated.
"
Person1,"I don't know what competitor you are referring to, but, no, we haven't seen it.
