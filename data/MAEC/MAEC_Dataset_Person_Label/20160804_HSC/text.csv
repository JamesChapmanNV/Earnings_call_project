Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"As I mentioned, there's a couple of items that occurred in the second quarter for Metals and some asset sale gains coupled with some, as I mentioned, some very positive results from our applied products, in particular, Reed Minerals businesses, which we don't expect to be retained.
"
Person1,"I think the margins should be, they should be consistent with the preceding quarter, previous year's quarter, a little better, and slightly down sequentially from where we saw in the second quarter.
"
Person1,"Improved margins over -- there's going to be improvement year-over-year, but it will be more or less down from the sequential quarter in this year in the matters I just mentioned.
"
Person0,"I think we've, over the past couple of years, shown that the aftermarket business has continued to exceed our expectations.

"
Person0,"No, there is not, only to say, one of them was brought back in and relaunched.

"
Person0,"Another one, we would expect to hear probably in the next six months or so.
"
Person0,"And then another one could be much sooner than that.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"The guidance we put forth, and I mentioned earlier, for Brand, the equity income pick-up is reflective of the dilution that we've already talked about.
"
Person1,"That's assuming we don't make any more payments for the rest of the year, which is what our plan was to be.
