Person3,"A couple things for me.
"
Person3,"Just the core loan growth outside of legacy growth outside of CFG.
"
Person3,"Were there also heavier payoffs in there in addition to what you saw in CFG.
"
Person3,"Is that kind of what you guys are saying.
"
Person3,"Maybe I missed that.
"
Person3,"Okay, certainly not -- I guess kind of the lower growth in the footprint outside of CFG, I guess anything in particular, is that more a function of rate or competition.
"
Person3,"What -- I guess, what given the health of the market, I guess what's kind of -- leading to the a little bit of the slower number there.
"
Person3,"Okay, would you say you're more guarded today on the growth in the kind of the core bank than you were earlier based on trend what you're seeing in the market or that's incorrect.
"
Person3,"Okay, that's helpful.
"
Person3,"And just maybe a couple for <UNK>.
"
Person3,"The -- on the accretion and the accretable and non accretable yields remain, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"What was that at, at first quarter.
"
Person3,"How much is remaining in each of those buckets.
"
Person3,"Okay.
"
Person3,"And then just the last things -- those -- the elevated benefit, I guess, if you will, in the service charge line as a result of the payoffs from CFG.
"
Person3,"Now that you guys talk about kind of the cycle maybe more into the cycle because they're 2 years in now, there was a benefit this quarter that hasn't been there may be in the past.
"
Person3,"But if payoffs continue given the cycle, should that number stay somewhat elevated.
"
Person3,"Maybe not at this level -- this quarter's level but higher than it has been over the past couple of years just given that dynamic now.
"
Person3,"Okay.
"
Person3,"All right, got you.
"
Person3,"And then just like you said in the liquidity (inaudible), the impact from that liquidity on the sub-debt, that impact this quarter would be about 15.
"
Person3,"If you do have any you think you would do it by June 30, that impact is about 15 basis points of the margin in the second quarter on the core basis.
"
Person3,"Okay.
"
Person3,"And then last one was just the core loan yield this quarter, did you guys say it was at 7 basis points of the increase linked quarter.
"
