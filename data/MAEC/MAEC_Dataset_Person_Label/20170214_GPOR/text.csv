Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, this is <UNK> again.
"
Person1,"The middle section of the Woodford has three identified intervals that we like to stay within.
"
Person1,"It's structurally complicated down here.
"
Person1,"Is folded and faulted.
"
Person1,"We do have the luxury of a lot of well control and 3-D seismic data over the area to help us stay in zone.
"
Person1,"You got kind of a trade-off of staying in the best rock for produceability and drill rate, but then you don't want to roller coaster borehole.
"
Person1,"You need a pretty flat trajectory.
"
Person1,"So that's our goal is to find a happy medium between all three of those and stay in zone with the drill bit.
"
Person0,"And there certainly will be some testing in areas with a lot of thickness of [wine racking] or staggered stacking lateral.
"
Person0,"So there's certainly some things that we can do to help us out there.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, it is interesting.
"
Person0,"I think that what the opportunity says is going to be for us or anyone is still I would call it a work in progress.
"
Person0,"We have to wait and see what kind of rigs people talk about adding back in the region, how they're going to be able to hold their acreage.
"
Person0,"So I guess it's hard question to answer but for us, I think we're just focused on blocking and tackling and filling our acreage so we can drill longer units.
"
Person0,"We do think will certainly have those opportunities.
"
Person0,"We want to increase our working interest, and really this applies to both Utica and SCOOP, quite frankly.
"
Person0,"You do see a little bit more robust land budget this year to account for that.
"
Person0,"But we feel comfortable with our ability to backfill and replace our inventory so that's what we're going to focus on.
"
Person0,"If the other opportunity presents itself, we'll take a look at if, but we don't have to do anything huge.
"
Person0,"I think it's really the same answer, and I will tell you that we've already met with all the offsetting operators.
"
Person0,"We are already having conversations about working together, trading acreage.
"
Person0,"So I do think we will be able to backfill our units so that we can drill longer laterals.
"
Person0,"But I think the same opportunity set that exists down there.
"
Person0,"I don't know if anything large is available but certainly lots of small stuff.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Donna.
"
Person0,"We appreciate your time and interest today.
"
Person0,"Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to our investor relations team.
"
Person0,"This concludes our call.
