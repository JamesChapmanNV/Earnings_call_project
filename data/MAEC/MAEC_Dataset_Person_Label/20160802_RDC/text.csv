Person1,"Yes <UNK>.
"
Person3,"That's one of the reasons we moved them there out of Southeast Asia.
"
Person3,"We were seeing a lot of pressure in the market in Southeast Asia, particularly with Petrobras forcing operators to use their rigs that are under contract first and then use local rigs.
"
Person3,"So we made a business decision to move those rigs into the Middle East.
"
Person3,"We believe that from that position we're seeing a lot of demand coming there for jack-ups in the UAE and Qatar -- Saudi Aramco still up in the air where they're going to shake out with their fleet.
"
Person3,"But they have about eight jack-ups rolling over this year and they are always looking to high-grade their fleet.
"
Person3,"So we've been in discussions with them on those rigs.
"
Person3,"As I mentioned earlier, demand in <UNK> Africa, those rigs are perfect to work in that region of the world and certainly in South America and Mexico.
"
Person3,"Sure.
"
Person3,"We've had numerous discussions with Repsol regarding blend and extend of the Renaissance.
"
Person3,"It is on standby right now in the US Gulf of Mexico.
"
Person3,"They're looking at projects in different areas of the world themselves to keep the rig working.
"
Person3,"We have talked to them about doing blend and extend, utilizing jack-ups, and their acquisition of Talisman in the North Sea with us having the Stavanger and the Norway idle.
"
Person3,"Those are options that are on the table.
"
Person3,"We have met with them both in Madrid and Houston.
"
Person3,"<UNK> and I were just there a few weeks ago, and the status is right now they are looking at where they think they can respond, but until that point -- we've given them numerous scenarios to try to work something out, but so far it's -- the ball's in their court as to where they're going to head with that.
"
Person3,"If there was enough demand certainly, short-term, that we would warrant moving it, of course, absolutely we would.
"
Person3,"But we're looking at a potential in the US Gulf of Mexico with an operator that's got up to a year's worth of work.
"
Person3,"We're also looking at Mexico as I mentioned earlier, and to mobilize the rig to <UNK> Africa from the US Gulf is going to be about the same as from the Middle East.
"
Person3,"So we think it's in a good spot, we're just trying to -- we are hopeful that some of these jobs would have materialized earlier.
"
Person3,"Unfortunately some of them have been pushed back a little bit, but that's the current plan for the rig right now.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"All right.
"
Person0,"We'd like to thank everyone for your interest in Rowan and joining us on today's call.
"
Person0,"If you have any additional questions, Carrie Prati and I will be available to take your calls.
"
Person0,"We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, thank you for coordinating the call, and good day everyone.
