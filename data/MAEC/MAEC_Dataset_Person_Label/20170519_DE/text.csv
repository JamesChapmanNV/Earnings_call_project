Person,Sentence
Person0,"<UNK>, the margin performance this quarter came despite warranty costs that were a headwind here.
"
Person0,"I'm wondering if you could talk about what's been driving the higher-quality costs for you folks over the past 2 years compared to history, and over what time frame would you expect warranties to return to the low 2% range that's more typical for you folks in the past.
"
Person0,"And sorry, <UNK>, over what time frame would you expect performance to return to more typical levels.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I mean, I think if you note where our working capital receivables and inventory forecasts are for the end of the year, I think it's appropriate to assume that next year is going to be up.
"
Person1,"We don't want to get into the 2018 forecast, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"But I think the statement that we have in terms of a shift in our thinking in terms of working capital at the end of the year should give you a good idea.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"And <UNK>, I think that's a good point.
"
Person1,"Now if you look at broader, longer-term global demand for commodities, still going up.
"
Person1,"And if you look at the USDA for the '17-'18 production forecast, it's lower, which means the stocks-to-use is what we're saying is likely to come down.
"
Person1,"And the equilibrium -- all we'll say is the equilibrium is getting tighter.
"
Person1,"Now we haven't put in our projections any disruption to the production for commodities.
"
Person1,"But if any of those should come up, there's even further upside, you're right.
"
Person1,"And to add to <UNK>'s point, if you look at the soybean prices, the current prices, you're right, they're down, okay, because of the additional soybean coming into the market from Brazil.
"
Person1,"But if you look at the futures, number futures, they haven't changed much.
"
Person1,"So that should help with what <UNK> just said.
"
Person1,"And then if you look at the longer term, since you brought up Brazil, longer-term ag export is very critical to Brazil and for their foreign exchange.
"
Person1,"And historically, you've seen governments, regardless of the party, support the ag sector very well.
"
Person1,"And we will -- while there is uncertainty, we cannot say what's likely to happen.
"
Person1,"And if you look at the past and if you look at what is good for Brazil, okay, we should -- we see them continuing to support the ag sector.
"
Person1,"And the percentage for Q4 is closer to 16%.
"
Person1,"If you just take the 9% for the full year, that's what it would work out there.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, we are making good progress with respect to the cost reduction -- structural cost reduction goal of $500-plus million that we talked about.
"
Person1,"Now you'll recall that when we talked about it, we said, if the investing conditions stay the same as in 2016 levels, we will aim to get over $500-plus million in structural cost reduction by the end of 2018, okay, so -- and be fully realized, end 2019.
"
Person1,"And a couple of things I will point out.
"
Person1,"While we are making very good progress towards the structural portion, the controllable part of cost reduction, there are some headwinds, one essentially being the material inflation.
"
Person1,"And then there is a second one that might confuse, when you look at the total picture, which is lever pulling.
"
Person1,"So as the volumes come up, we had pulled a lot of levers over the last 3 years, and as the volumes come up, we'll be releasing some of those.
"
Person1,"But if you look at the underlying structural cost reduction, we are making very good progress.
"
Person1,"And we are committed to hit the $500-plus million that we talked about.
"
Person2,"You actually kind of just answered the question, but is there a way to parse out how much of the increase on the construction side was from some of the new products deal at CONEXPO.
"
Person2,"You did talk about some of the smaller -- the mini class, but also there's a fair amount going on, on the production side class there as well.
"
Person2,"And then lastly, could you mention anything about the parts commitment having any impact on the sales outlook.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, can you talk about how you view normalized margins in Ag & Turf.
"
Person0,"Obviously, really strong performance here towards the bottom of the cycle.
"
Person0,"And so if you apply your normal operating leverage, that would get you to 15%, 17%-type margins at normalized volumes.
"
Person0,"And I'm wondering, at which point do you folks start to think about, is that too high from a competitive standpoint.
"
Person0,"How do you think about what's normalized in this cycle for you.
