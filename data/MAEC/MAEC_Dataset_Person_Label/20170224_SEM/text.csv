Person0,"This compares to $3.21 billion last year.
"
Person0,"As a percent of net revenue, cost of services decreased 30 basis points to 85.5%.
"
Person0,"This compares to 85.8% last year.
"
Person0,"The decrease in cost of services as a percent of net revenue was the result of cost reductions achieved by Concentra, which were partially offset by an increase in Specialty Hospital cost of services as a percentage of revenue.

Person0,"G&A expense was $25.7 million in the fourth quarter, which as a percent of net revenue is 2.5%, compared to $24.1 million, or 2.3% of net revenue for the same quarter last year.

Person0,"This compares to $4 million in the same quarter last year.
"
Person0,"During the year we generated $19.9 million of equity and earnings, compared to $16.8 million last year.
"

"
Person0,"In addition, $11.9 million was provided from the issuance of non-controlling interests, and $10.7 million in proceeds from bank overdrafts.
"
Person0,"As Bob mentioned, Select is in the process of refinancing its senior credit facilities, and we expect to complete the transaction early next month.
"
Person0,"The proposed financing remains subject to certain closing conditions, and the effects of the refinancing are not included in our current financial guidance for calendar year 2017, which I will reaffirm for you now.
"
Person0,"This includes net revenue expected to the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of $540 million to $580 million, and fully diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.91.
"
Person0,"This concludes our prepared remarks, and at this point in time, I would like to turn it back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.
"
Person0,"Sure, <UNK>, let us give you a bridge to get you to both the improvement in the margin, as well as the increase in total overall EBITDA.
"
Person0,"So if you take a look at where we ended up for 2016, we ended up at close to $466 million.
"
Person0,"And if you take a look at our business segments, you can take a look at on the Specialty Hospital side, first take a look at inpatient rehab.
"
Person0,"Inpatient rehab, we had about $22 million worth of start-up losses associated with the three projects that Bob talked about, which were CRI, TriHealth, and Cleveland Clinic.
"
Person0,"We anticipate that those will generate somewhere in the neighborhood of $15 million to $18 million worth of EBITDA.
"
Person0,"That in and of itself, is a $40 million swing.
"
Person0,"Plus the overall business we anticipate on the inpatient rehab side to be about another $5 million, so all told for the inpatient rehab facilities would be about $45 million.
"
Person0,"On the outpatient rehab side, we acquired Physio in March of 2016.
"
Person0,"So if you annualize that, plus add back the synergies, the $20 million of synergies that we expect to get from that, plus the growth from our legacy business, that is about another $25 million.
"
Person0,"And then on Concentra, Concentra had a fabulous year in 2016, so we anticipate the growth on a same-store basis will be pretty modest, probably in that $5 million range.
"
Person0,"So adding all of those up, you're going to come up with about $75 million, which will get you to in that $540 million to $545 million range.
"
Person0,"And then the balance of the year, or the balance of 2017 will really be a function of the volume increases that we see on the LTAC business.
"
Person0,"And that is really where that's coming from.
"
Person0,"No, I think certainly we had a lot going on in 2016.
"
Person0,"I think the improvement in the margins in 2017 will be more attuned to our business moving forward.
"
Person0,"And I think the other thing to point out is the CRI development that we did is a very unique development.
"
Person0,"It's a very large project, as Bob had mentioned in the opening of the call.
"
Person0,"And we don't anticipate seeing those types of projects very often.
"
Person0,"So from that perspective, that had a very detrimental impact on the margins in 2016.
"
Person0,"There was not, but it was about $4 million for the quarter.
"
