Person,Sentence
Person1,"Concerning the Lilly relationship, you have to remember that the way it works is we will be asked at some point when the program is going to Phase 3 to either obtain or not the co-financing of the Phase 3.
"
Person1,"Before that, we are literally in a position where we give our opinion and our advice, but we are really not in any kind of decision-making position.
"
Person1,"I cannot comment on their willingness to go for any of these indications.
"
Person1,"As you said, I think we are dealing with a very broad list of possible indications for this mechanism.
"
Person1,"Lilly, and we are discussing this with them, is looking in multiple places where baricitinib could be applied.
"
Person1,"The decision to drop diabetic nephropathy recently is something that was not a huge surprise from our side.
"
Person1,"On financial health, you can see the numbers yourself.
"
Person1,"We are in a position where the growth of the top line is giving us a lot of flexibility to invest in our own portfolio and if Lilly would decide to go in an additional indication, which I wish, we would be able to do the co-funding.
"
Person1,"To give you an idea from last year to this year in terms of co-funding, the Lilly program has gone down because of the cycle in rheumatoid arthritis.
"
Person1,"If we were to go in a new indication, there would be no problem to do that.
"
Person1,"The way we are thinking of our resource allocation is obviously top line growth is what is giving us all of these opportunities.
"
Person1,"We spoke about ruxolitinib but we have also now hopefully if baricitinib is approved next year there would be a new line of top line growth from the royalties and some of the milestones from Lilly.
"
Person1,"We think about portfolio kinetics, how to move the portfolio as fast as possible in the right indication, obviously, based on the scientific understanding we have.
"
Person1,"We are not limiting our clinical program because of resource constraints at this point.
"
Person1,"Based on what you have seen this quarter you can see we have room to maneuver and obviously stay in a positive cash flow from operations.
"
Person1,"That's important because that is what makes us stable from the financial standpoint and able to do this operation.
"
Person1,"Of those 3 criteria that we are using and up to now it has been something we have been able to manage very positively.
"
Person1,"So the answer is yes if there were opportunities to do co-funding with Lilly, we would probably participate assuming the indication is reasonable.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Thank you for your time today and for your questions.
"
Person1,"I'll just conclude saying that we look forward to providing you with further updates with the Q3 call in early November for now thank you and goodbye.
