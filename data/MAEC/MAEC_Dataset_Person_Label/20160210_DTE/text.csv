Person0,"Well, I think a couple of things.
"
Person0,"One, it had been a very long time since our prior rate case.
"
Person0,"So there was a lot that we were addressing in the rate case directly preceding.
"
Person0,"And then if you simply look at the pace of capital expenditure last year, and projected this year in the forward test year, it's a significant spend that we have underway.
"
Person0,"And we need a rate case to deal with that.
"
Person0,"So I think historically, we've tried to spread our rate cases out and have been pretty successful in doing that.
"
Person0,"Our prior case had been four years since the preceding case.
"
Person0,"That won't be the case in the future, given where things stand.
"
Person0,"We are investing in both distribution and generation at a healthy enough pace that we are going to need to be in every year or year-and-a-half.
"
Person1,"I think just even to add on that, to give you a perspective, in the case we just filed, there is a $1 billion rate based increase from the final order we just received.
"
Person1,"To just give you the sense that there is a pace of capital spend that we have over and above depreciation.
"
Person0,"Yes, I think it is.
"
Person1,"In every -- probably in every calendar year, at some point in that year, we'll be filing.
"
Person0,"We did.
"
Person0,"I generally said that, given the share issuance effect, the combination of the two makes it a very modest impact for us.
"
Person0,"So it's not a significant player in our plan.
"
Person0,"It pulls our share issuance down fundamentally; does have some impact in utility earnings, but the two heavily offset each other.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Well we did revise down our electric segment a bit.
"
Person1,"Just to reiterate what <UNK> said, there is minimal impact.
"
Person1,"I would say it's relatively small in terms of the earnings growth.
"
Person1,"But there is a bit of the utility growth that's taken off just because of the bonus depreciation being used versus equity.
"
Person1,"But there is an offset corporately on the earnings-per-share.
"
Person1,"It's pretty minimal.
"
Person1,"There is bonus depreciation.
"
Person1,"And for the electric segment, there was a fine tuning of the ROE that came up .
"
Person1,"10.3%.
"
Person0,"Which gas segment to you talking.
"
Person0,"The --.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"The combination of that is, we knew going into the fourth quarter, the -- some of the weather impacts, so we did go in a bit of a lean mode in that fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"So that helped the earnings out.
"
Person1,"And there was also some timing of taxes that played out in between the years.
"
Person1,"That is correct.
"
Person1,"And the other is, as I was mentioning in my speaking notes, 2014, we had a really strong weather year, so we had a reinvestment plan.
"
Person1,"A lot of it took place in the fourth quarter of 2014.
"
Person1,"So you are seeing investment that occurred in 2014.
"
Person1,"And then a lean that offset and went the other way in 2015.
"
Person0,"So, put differently, we started talking about El Nino in like July, and we knew it was a distinct possibility.
"
Person0,"So we had plans lined up for our gas utility that, if it reared its head, we would implement lean late in the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"And we did.
"
Person0,"And it turned out we are glad we did, because it turned out to be an incredibly warm December.
"
Person0,"We had the opposite, the flip a year before, coming off that really cold winter, we invested ahead.
"
Person0,"But we invested ahead in 2014 to enable something like we ran into in 2015.
"
Person0,"And that's kind of the way we do things, that we invest in stronger years to give you the flexibility to do the opposite in years when you need to.
"
Person0,"And you can do that without affecting the quality of your assets as long as you keep that even-handed.
"
Person0,"Well, I think if you look at the whole sector, there's quite a few that share prices have come down fundamentally and are sub-investment grade.
"
Person0,"So, we are watching those.
"
Person0,"But I -- as I said earlier, we don't -- so, they are sub-investment grade but we aren't picking up, in our counterparties, kind of the scramble to rework timing or rework commitments.
"
Person0,"In fact, on one of our pipe positions, we had credit requirements that caused them to post collateral, and they went ahead and did it.
"
Person0,"Because the position is important to them, and so they want to move -- they want to continue on.
"
Person0,"So we'd be silly not to be watching our counterparties carefully, but we haven't seen any yet that have tilted into the mode where we think there's something near-term.
"
Person0,"We've been working that payout ratio, so we have a stated payout ratio.
"
Person0,"And what we've generally done is push it up into the middle of the payout range, and it falls back to the front-end, and we push it back up to the middle.
"
Person0,"So, that pattern is probably what you can expect in the future.
"
Person0,"You are right.
"
Person0,"We've grown earnings a bit faster than we have dividends.
"
Person0,"So, we'll keep an eye on what you suggested.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Right.
"
Person0,"We don't see any evidence of that.
"
Person0,"And we have the chance to deal with counterparties across a lot of fronts, including our utilities.
"
Person0,"So, you generally know when somebody is in that position, they start to dance on commitments.
"
Person0,"And we're just not seeing that.
"
Person0,"Well, I think there was -- there were -- predictably, there are some parties on the retail open access side who would prefer that things simply stay the way they are.
"
Person0,"So there was some noise about that.
"
Person0,"I think the key to that will be putting together -- I mentioned a coalition, and Senator Nofs working on a coalition.
"
Person0,"I think the key is to get a business coalition that comes together and says actually these are the right things to do.
"
Person0,"It's the right future direction for the state and it's fair.
"
Person0,"And I think we'll be able to put that business coalition together.
"
Person0,"So, you can probably imagine who it was saying that retail open access is fine just the way it is.
"
Person0,"It was some alternative providers and a few people that they were backing.
"
Person0,"But I do think we'll be able to deal with that issue.
"
Person0,"Beyond that, there are -- I'd say there's some back-and-forth on exactly what the IRP process should look like, but I don't think that will be a holdup.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Well, we don't really have any additional information for you.
"
Person0,"I'd just say that we appreciate you being with us this morning, and your support, and look forward to any follow-up questions that you have.
"
Person0,"Thanks very much for joining us.
"
Person0,"We look forward to a good 2016.
