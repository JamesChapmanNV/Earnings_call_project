Person0,"Happy new year, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That's really an interesting question, I think, and there's really two parts to the answer.
"
Person0,"One is what we do -- we talked about improving our yields in Kansas as an example.
"
Person0,"We talked about our new products, which are higher-margin products.
"
Person0,"So we have to look at the content of the revenue and also our costs, which we were always going after however we can.
"
Person0,"Of course, we are dealing with costs.
"
Person0,"There's a limit.
"
Person0,"Your costs can't be less than zero.
"
Person0,"There's a limit to how much you can do with costs, but I don't think we will ever stop looking at our costs.
"
Person0,"And obviously as you commented, the product content has a big impact on margins as well.
"
Person0,"And having said that in the short-term, especially the topline revenue line is going to have a big impact on gross margins.
"
Person0,"So if revenues fell off in the fourth quarter, that's going to have an impact on gross margins.
"
Person0,"If they came up, they have an impact on gross margins.
"
Person0,"I think that if we start to see some movement up in our revenues and our long-term planning has always been consistent with revenues moving up, that that upward trajectory of revenues will have a positive impact on gross margins.
"
Person0,"It's just simple math.
"
Person0,"(technical difficulty).
"
Person0,"On the two factors are what we do in terms of our cost, in terms of our product mix, product introduction.
"
Person0,"And then on a short-term basis, what the market does in terms of ups or downs in revenues.
"
Person0,"Long-term our objective would be to have gross margins, which would be over 30%.
"
Person0,"Well, at this point, we don't think that GE is going to help us, not in the 2016 calendar year in terms of any kind of revenue growth.
"
Person0,"So we really weren't proposing that if you figure it that way.
"
Person0,"But I think it's not a bad way to think of it, <UNK>, for Q3, and that might be not a bad model for 2016.
"
Person0,"Now with GE, we are working calendar years.
"
Person0,"So, as I mentioned, 2017 calendar, we are expected based on the forecast to see some upward movement to a level more than we were for the first part of this year.
"
Person0,"As a forecast, we don't know whether it's going to come true or not, but that takes into account also what we are discussing regarding the inventory work down.
"
Person0,"The only point is that that could have an impact upon the next fiscal year because that's the beginning of 2017 calendar will have a little bit of an impact upon the next fiscal year.
"
Person0,"As far as other programs, there's nothing significant that we are aware of that will have a major impact -- upward impact on revenues in the -- or aerospace in the coming year.
"
Person0,"So that doesn't -- I guess I should be clear because I don't want to mislead anybody intentionally -- that doesn't mean that revenues won't move up, but it's not like we could point to a big program and say, okay, here's your forecast.
"
Person0,"This is what's expected each quarter, and therefore, we can predict revenues moving up, which would be the case with a larger program often, but most of what we do in aerospace is still not GE.
"
Person0,"It's a lot of smaller programs which are less predictable for us, and those are the things we're going after.
"
Person0,"We also -- I guess I should add that we talked about GE as if it's a zero-sum game, but it's really not true.
"
Person0,"We are almost in a constant state of being qualified for other GE programs outside of the cells and thrust reversers.
"
Person0,"That's where we started -- in the GE facility in Baltimore that produces those products, and that's where we are pretty much sole-source.
"
Person0,"But there are very significant opportunities with GE Aviation for the engine itself, the fixed structure of the engine itself, and we seem to be in a constant state of being qualified on those opportunities.
"
Person0,"So that's a factor that we really can't quantify too well at this point.
"
Person0,"It's a little bit of a wildcard, but it's all positive.
"
Person0,"What we're talking about is the baseline -- what we know, what is ours, what we have.
"
Person0,"There is upside even this year with GE, but that's more difficult to quantify.
"
Person0,"I know that's a rambling answer, but I'm not suggesting what you do because you are smarter than I am as an analyst.
"
Person0,"But I don't think it's a bad idea to look at Q3 a little bit and think, well, this might be something I could use as a basis for a model for the coming year.
"
Person0,"I would not disagree with that.
"
Person0,"I'm not recommending that.
"
Person0,"We're not forecasting that, but I don't think that's an illogical or unreasonable approach.
"
Person0,"And obviously, <UNK>, I just want to add, it's our objective to beat that number, and that's what we are working on every day, to beat that number.
"
Person0,"Beat those kind of numbers.
"
Person1,"I think those costs, we are always looking at opportunities to improve our cost structure.
"
Person1,"But the level that we're at is we have some base that we are probably working off of here.
"
Person1,"So movement from that base, assuming we stay right around this revenue level, is probably not going to be very significant.
"
Person1,"I can't think of anything that would materially change it in the near-term.
"
Person0,"You're welcome.
"
Person0,"Thank you, operator.
"
Person0,"One more thing I'd like to mention -- hopefully some people are still listening -- is that there is a live webcast at the Needham conference.
"
Person0,"I think it's a week from today, and that's available to anybody, and you might want to tune in for that if you are interested.
"
Person0,"We will be doing a presentation about Park -- and not just going through quarters, it's more just the history of Park and what we're doing because it's also intended for people that don't know much about our Company.
"
Person0,"So I just want to mention that to you.
"
Person0,"And having said that, thank you very much for listening in on our third-quarter conference call.
"
Person0,"And again, I'd like to wish everybody in the audience a very happy new year and the best of luck in 2016 to all of you.
"
