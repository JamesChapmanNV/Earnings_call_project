Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"The growth in paid downloads follows the growth of the e-commerce business.
"
Person1,"So it tracks pretty well to that.
"
Person1,"As far as the strategy, let's go back a few years.
"
Person1,"So when we went public our strategy was at the time we were a Company that was just over $100 million of revenue and we were building what was at the time a relatively new enterprise business.
"
Person1,"We were expanding our video product and we were building the business internationally.
"
Person1,"We took that three-pronged strategy now, almost five years later, and did a really good job with that.
"
Person1,"The business is nearly $500 million in revenue, nearly $100 million of EBITDA.
"
Person1,"And today what we are focused on is taking our transactional marketplace and turning it into an end-to-end platform.
"
Person1,"So, what we did in 2015 and 2016 is build -- rebuild our entire tech platform in order to do that, in order to take the Company from being a transactional marketplace to having many more touch points with the customer over their entire creative lifecycle for using imagery, deploying imagery, creating imagery and measuring imagery.
"
Person1,"We have a lot of work left to do and we are going to continue to build on top of the platform.
"
Person1,"This is not something that we do for the next quarter, for the next year -- this is a multi-year strategy and it expands our addressable market pretty significantly.
"
Person1,"If you think of stock imagery as a $5 billion to $10 billion addressable market, you take the total workflow market, and that is many tens of billions of dollars of addressable market.
"
Person1,"So, we think we have a great platform; we have a great model.
"
Person1,"We have great starting point, which is selling over five images per second to businesses all around the world, and we are going to work off of that starting point.
"
Person1,"To start on Editor, Editor since the beginning of our workflow product and we plan to build that out further.
"
Person1,"We are not disclosing any specific metrics on Editor, but we have said that people that use Editor do buy more photos from us and it increases engagement.
"
Person1,"And we will continue to try to increase engagement.
"
Person1,"On the lower-priced subscriptions, we are just moving to where the market is.
"
Person1,"We saw -- we see other segments of customers that are willing to buy from us on lower volume packages.
"
Person1,"And we are going to offer those lower volume packages to them when it makes sense.
"
Person1,"It is hard to just break out micro stock and, in fact, micro stock has had several definitions over the years.
"
Person1,"I can tell you that businesses of all sizes have not decreased their need for imagery.
"
Person1,"Every business needs imagery to sell their product or service and we are increasingly becoming the place that people go to get those images.
"
Person1,"We will also continuously become more of a place that people go to work on those images and we will be more in the workflow of all of these businesses.
"
Person1,"Look, today we have 1.7 million customers, those are mostly businesses.
"
Person1,"There are tens and tens of millions of customers out there that could be buying our product and our goal is to get them.
"
Person1,"We plan to plug into every single place that a person would need an image.
"
Person1,"We will do this with our API; we will do it actively where we partner with a company and will allow other companies to integrate with our API directly.
"
Person1,"You mentioned one, Adobe, that is just one of our connectors; we plan to be everywhere a business needs an image.
"
Person1,"Well, I will start.
"
Person1,"If you look at -- 2016 was a year of re-platforming a lot of the Company, a lot of the way that we work on our products, a lot of the way that we develop our products and a lot of the code that our products get launched onto.
"
Person1,"2017 is going to be the year that we build on that technological platform and we continue to innovate on behalf of the customer.
"
Person1,"We are not going to give much detail about our products.
"
Person1,"We are the only public company in this space and we are going to continue to innovate and deliver for the customer every day like we do.
"
Person1,"Maybe I will start on video.
"
Person1,"Video is an important part of our offering.
"
Person1,"Video is growing faster than the Company is growing, both on the customer and on the contributor side.
"
Person1,"Video is still a complicated thing to use.
"
Person1,"And as we get better with our workflow efforts we plan to make video easier and easier to use for customers.
"
Person1,"Today it is very difficult and we have proven with Editor that we can make simple transforms of imagery a lot easier for the customer and we plan to do that with video as well.
"
