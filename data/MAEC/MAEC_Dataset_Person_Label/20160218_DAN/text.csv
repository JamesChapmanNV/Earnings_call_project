Person1,"There was a $25 million pricing action, that benefited the EBITDA, that partially offset the supplier transition warranty cost that I mentioned.
"
Person1,"That would not be one-time.
"
Person1,"That pricing action continues into the future.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"We haven't typically provided content per vehicle kind of data, and don't really have that at my fingertips to give that to you.
"
Person0,"No, there is incremental content.
"
Person0,"I can tell you that, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"<UNK> is telling me no, so I guess no.
"
Person0,"(laughter) Look, I like your effort.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"We're certainly -- this is <UNK> speaking.
"
Person1,"We're not looking for it to improve, quite frankly, in 2016.
"
Person1,"We're just hunkered down there, doing everything we can to keep the cost base as minimal as possible.
"
Person1,"So I think the improvement we expect is going to be post-2016.
"
Person1,"Not significantly.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Thank you again, everyone, for joining the call.
"
Person0,"Just a quick summary, from my standpoint anyway, there's no question that we had a bit of a difficult year in the Commercial Vehicle group, largely due to currency in the Brazilian market.
"
Person0,"But the group is certainly stable now, and improving every day.
"
Person0,"However, I'm sure it's not lost on anyone that three of the four business units performed exceptionally well, and continue to perform at a very high level.
"
Person0,"Even that, with some very challenging end markets, which will naturally improve some day.
"
Person0,"Now, after six months at Dana, I would say I'm very excited about Dana, and our prospects, and frankly, achieving our guidance as we presented not only in January, but we reiterated today.
"
Person0,"So thank you very much for your support, and joining the call.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
"
