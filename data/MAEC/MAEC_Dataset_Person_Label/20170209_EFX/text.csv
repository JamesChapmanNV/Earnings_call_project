Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Let me see if I can deconstruct what your view is, which is a good view, and say that it is in the teens.
"
Person0,"You also have, don't forget, two months of Veda benefit in 2017 you didn't have in 2016.
"
Person0,"So that's part of the contributor.
"
Person0,"Then the core of what you're saying is true.
"
Person0,"You have very high, once again, very high organic non-mortgage, non-ACA growth, and there's no magic there.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, that is the same thing we've been doing since [PGI] and EGI.
"
Person0,"It's really is broad-based.
"
Person0,"If I went through, and I think I did, I can't remember, as an example I think I gave EWS, the number of verticals that are growing double digit.
"
Person0,"I can do the same thing in International.
"
Person0,"I can pick different countries, and different verticals in different countries.
"
Person0,"I can take different verticals in the USIS and show you how they're growing.
"
Person0,"It's so broad-based.
"
Person0,"It's not one vertical, it's not two verticals.
"
Person0,"It's not one product or two product.
"
Person0,"It's a combination of all those things coming together.
"
Person1,"As <UNK> mentioned in his script, right, you're seeing continued very strong double-digit growth out of EWS, and then out of International, and GCS growing above their long-term model.
"
Person1,"So the areas of growth are really concentrated there.
"
Person1,"USIS, still performing well relative to mortgage, but the growth is concentrated in those businesses that <UNK> talked about.
"
Person0,"Yes, traditionally that's been the case that they've pre-screen, the precursor to underwriting, which that puts you online stuff.
"
Person0,"So we're not explicitly baked that into any guidance, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We expect, though, if that is in our pre-screen that will eventually lead to more lending, which is good for us.
"
Person0,"Yes, good point.
"
Person0,"So the answer to your first question is ACA was not directly counted in that 3%.
"
Person0,"The 3% is the mortgage headwind alone.
"
Person0,"Again, we're saying (inaudible) what you do, you can do the math, was the growth driver in the past goes from being a growth driver to flat.
"
Person0,"That is a headwind for us.
"
Person0,"The rest has got offset, and we got offset.
"
Person0,"Think about the guidance we gave you as being offset by things we're already doing.
"
Person0,"So it's a combination of NPI and EGI.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"One of the things, maybe before -- hopefully you guys are still on the phone, is that, <UNK>, if I could.
"
Person0,"Two points have came up in a few (inaudible) we would address.
"
Person0,"One was around the OIS revenue when compared it to others up 4% versus some of you expected that to be larger.
"
Person0,"Point of clarification, where it estimated that some of your (inaudible), that is burdened by 2 points, was it 2 points.
"
Person0,"3 points of headwind from what we call our direct-to-consumer business.
"
Person0,"Remember, when we created GCS, we took most of our consumer and gave it to GCS.
"
Person0,"We left behind some reports marked to TU and to Experian.
"
Person0,"That has been declining.
"
Person0,"That declined even faster in the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"You've heard Experian announced they had a big breach last year in the fourth quarter; that didn't repeat.
"
Person0,"So that's 3 points of headwind this year versus [less headwind] in the first three quarters of the year.
"
Person0,"The other question that was raised is the sequential margin change in EWS.
"
Person0,"I think I'll just quickly talk about that.
"
Person0,"That's driven by really two things.
"
Person0,"You've got some seasonality in a couple products in the mix.
"
Person0,"We're still (inaudible) in the high margin offerings in the [USIS] that you may have seen in the third quarter.
"
Person0,"Secondly, as I mentioned and <UNK> mentioned, we're investing nicely in standing up the International work number.
"
Person0,"Those are two small points that are sequentially working the margin (inaudible) to explain that.
"
Person0,"That business is a still well on its way to get that 50% to or mid-50%s margin.
"
Person0,"I just wanted to clarify that point.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, you want sing a song or something like that (laughter) farewell.
"
