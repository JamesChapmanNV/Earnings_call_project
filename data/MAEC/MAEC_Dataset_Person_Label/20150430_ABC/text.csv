Person,Sentence
Person1,"I mean AmerisourceBergen Switzerland is a platform.
"
Person1,"I think it's helped coordinate with WBAD but it's also a new interface mechanism.
"
Person1,"As I pointed out I think we gave extensive comments on that and there's a lot of innovation in that group.
"
Person1,"I've just spent the weekend with them meeting with some of our key suppliers.
"
Person1,"So we do think there could be opportunity there to carry on doing more services abroad.
"
Person1,"BluePoint is a great driver for our business.
"
Person1,"It's been well received in the marketplace.
"
Person1,"So the mix of business I think is looking favorable in terms of international businesses.
"
Person1,"And also World Courier if you look at corporate, World Courier is a good driver for us with above market growth prospects.
"
Person1,"And I think we're starting to make some good progress there on really looking at those ICS orphan drug distribution opportunities, we've got a couple of new facilities that we've introduced particularly in Asia.
"
Person1,"So I think again the investments we've made, the business emphasis, the people it's quite an extraordinary time at AmerisourceBergen.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, let me clarify that.
"
Person2,"The contract was really -- it was through September 30 of 2015.
"
Person2,"We just extended it for a year under the same terms and conditions.
"
Person2,"So no impact whatsoever to our Q3, Q4 this year.
"
Person1,"No, I said that was a manufacturer mandated programs and they still dropship programs that are being built by our drug company essentially but coordinated through ASD Healthcare.
"
Person1,"So there are distribution contracts and the economics are really comparable.
"
Person1,"These were manufacturers looking to use more of the specialty model on the inventory side with a centralized location.
"
Person1,"So it's not going through a pharmacy program.
"
Person1,"We tried to be very consultative with the manufacturers.
"
Person1,"I think overall the customers prefer it to come with their regular drug delivery.
"
Person1,"There are certain products you look at the legacy of ASD.
"
Person1,"It started off of course with blood plasma products.
"
Person1,"We do a lot of work in through vaccine, both our ASD and Besse divisions and there is now some specialty products where there is unique data requirements for the manufacturers, might have a REMS program or some area like that.
"
Person1,"And they would like ASP-impacted products, sometimes it makes more sense to go through the specialty distribution as opposed to through broad line wholesale.
"
Person1,"But we try to be very consultative and thoughtful about both approaches and including taking the customers' perspective but manufacturers have views on especially the larger manufacturers on how this product should be distributed throughout the supply chain.
"
Person1,"So we have all the tools so whatever the requirements are.
"
Person1,"I don't know about low value but I think it's maturer products.
"
Person1,"And certainly where there's quite a few participants in the market there has to be those sort of conditions prevalent for us to do a private label program.
"
Person1,"And it's really done in conjunction with the manufacturers.
"
Person1,"And I don't think it's that dissimilar than the European model but I'm not an expert on that.
"
Person1,"So I would say it's fairly similar circumstances in order to do a private label program.
"
Person2,"Well again that's one of the three components that I called out, it's grown and increased quickly over the last couple of years.
"
Person2,"If it continues to grow it will help that mix.
"
Person2,"So I guess the short answer is it could, yes, it could help drive it could help influence our tax rate.
"
Person2,"I think we still have a ways to go.
"
Person2,"It's an area that we continue to focus on.
"
Person1,"Yes and we like to partner with WBAD and the success of Almus, so we think there's some opportunities there and now that WBA is together we really are starting to focus on that.
"
Person1,"And I think AmerisourceBergen Swissco, Switzerland I should say is of course going to be very constructive for that.
"
Person2,"Hey, <UNK>, it's <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I will start.
"
Person2,"The DoD will impact us two months in the June quarter, May and June, and then will impact us for the entire September quarter.
"
Person2,"So we will have that, and again as we talked about it is a significant reduction to market but it is, the offset to that is it's a long-term contract with a growing very good customer.
"
Person2,"The generic -- your second question on generic Abilify it's not in our guidance.
"
Person2,"We haven't contemplated -- it's too new.
"
Person2,"And that's I guess the easy way to say that's a TBD.
"
Person2,"We'll have to wait to see how that works and in terms of uptake in the market and also the margin and how many also as we come to market manufacturers.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Now before we go <UNK> would like to make some final comments.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you <UNK> and we are now concluding one of the most memorable quarters in ABC's history.

Person1,"I've actually been very active this quarter throughout the ABC universe as we've had many customer and internal meetings.
"
Person1,"I am tremendously proud of the engagement and passion of the ABC associates.
"
Person1,"This is true throughout our Company including our international assets.
"
Person1,"And we highlighted the third anniversary of our acquisition here in the clinical trial space so we could not be more thrilled of our overall portfolio.
"
Person1,"I just want to give a special welcome to MWI which is our largest acquisition to date where we continue to be thrilled about the quality of the service, the customer base and the people that literally continue to delight us.
"
Person1,"So thank you for your attention and interest in ABC.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"And I'd just like to highlight our upcoming conference activity before we go.
"
Person0,"We will be attending the Deutsche Bank Healthcare Conference in Boston on May 6, the Bank of America Healthcare Conference in Los Angeles on May 11, the UBS Healthcare Conference in New York on May 18 and the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 9.
