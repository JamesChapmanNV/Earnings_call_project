Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, I will let <UNK> take that question, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Hi, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"We captured all of that in that one bucket of costs as you can see and as you noted.
"
Person2,"We said we were -- on the last call on the fourth quarter call that, if you take that $30 million and you look at it on a quarterly run rate, I think we said we had a pretty significant portion in Q4 and then we are kind of hitting our target here in Q1.
"
Person2,"So, there is some incremental but not a lot on the fixed cost side from Q4 to Q1.
"
Person2,"And then, whatever is left is, call it variable.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"As I mentioned, <UNK>, the $4 million was part of our operating income in Q1.
"
Person2,"That was an insurance recovery.
"
Person2,"We had some extra costs last year related to that particular issue.
"
Person2,"So, it is just part of the flow in operating income.
"
Person2,"That's going to move around a bit based on some interest rate swaps and some other things but I would say that could be fairly consistent on run rate.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you again for participating on today's call.
"
Person0,"We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
"
Person0,"Thank you and goodbye.
