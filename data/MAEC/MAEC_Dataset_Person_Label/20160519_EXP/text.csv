Person,Sentence
Person1,"<UNK>, at some point, you get to a basic level, not too different than frankly, what we saw a few years ago in housing starts.
"
Person1,"You get down to a necessity level for that, but we're down pretty low.
"
Person1,"Look we -- kind of the first half of calendar 2015, I'd say demand as we had spoke was down 50%.
"
Person1,"We've seen another leg down, which gets you down to that down 80% in total.
"
Person1,"So that it's happened pretty swift.
"
Person1,"We'll see what happens in drilling activity from here.
"
Person1,"But we're at pretty low levels at this point.
"
Person1,"Most of that has been done, right, on the oil well cement.
"
Person1,"But that's happened.
"
Person1,"Again, you've got the weather comparison from the prior year, so we'll see how weather goes through the rest of the year.
"
Person1,"But the oil well shift has happened.
"
Person0,"What we do know is the rig counts are down.
"
Person0,"The oil service companies continue to struggle financially.
"
Person0,"The E&P's continue to reduce capital.
"
Person0,"There's little pressure on price.
"
Person0,"We think we're approaching the bottom.
"
Person0,"We also think the second half of our fiscal year will be a little bit better than the first half of our fiscal year.
"
Person1,"That was really through -- mostly through the end of the March quarter, the 1 million shares that we commented there.
"
Person1,"There's some shares that settle post the quarter, just the way the shares are settled through the financial institutions.
"
Person1,"Once you enter a blackout period or an earnings period, there's is some limitations on the stock repurchases.
"
Person1,"So the vast majority of that 1 million shares was in the March quarter and the first few days of April.
"
Person0,"As we speak, we are working with our customers to renegotiate supply agreements.
"
Person0,"We're looking a little bit different customer base than we originally sold.
"
Person0,"We're also working with customers to reduce costs delivered to their well, so we are actively working that at this point, yes.
"
Person0,"Our focus now is to breakeven in the short term and position ourself to make some good money in the long term.
"
Person0,"If we do those things right we will pick up a little bit of share.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, in the frac sand business, there's a number of railcars that are underutilized, as you would expect.
"
Person1,"We are going through the process currently of trying to improve those lease rates as best we can or utilize those cars in other parts of our business.
"
Person1,"So, that is well under way.
"
Person1,"That's part of the negotiation process that we're in right now, to make sure those lease times -- those cars as necessary are used and to the extent not necessary, renegotiate the timing of those leases and the underlying cost of those leases.
"
Person0,"I wouldn't put much -- attribute much to the weather at all.
"
Person0,"I think a lot of it is the market growth.
"
Person0,"We're very fortunate the markets that we play in grew faster than a lot of the other markets.
"
Person0,"We took full advantage of that.
"
Person0,"But I think very little had to do with weather to be honest with you.
"
Person0,"That's my read, yes.
"
Person0,"First of all, four of our five gypsum plants are on natural gypsum --
"
Person0,"So we feel very good.
"
Person0,"We have decades of supply.
"
Person0,"In South Carolina, our plant does run on synthetic gypsum.
"
Person0,"We have the ability to run on actual gypsum and more importantly, we're teamed up with a terrific partner in Santee Cooper.
"
Person0,"We built our plant on their property.
"
Person0,"We have a 52-year lease on that property and a 52-year agreement for supply.
"
Person0,"We fully expect Santee Cooper to continue to live up to their agreement.
"
Person0,"But I will tell you that there are trends for fewer coal-fired power plants ahead.
"
Person0,"Those that have invested in scrubbers have a greater likelihood to keep running.
"
Person0,"It's really a situation that's plant and market specific.
"
Person0,"This also applies to fly ash as well as synthetic gypsum.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, obviously, we wouldn't talk about any specific opportunities.
"
Person1,"But needless to say, look, we continue to look for growth in the heavy side and adjacent businesses in slag and fly ash would certainly meet that right criteria.
"
Person1,"It will come down to valuation.
"
Person1,"I'm not going to overpay for the privilege and generating higher than industry average returns.
"
Person1,"That's something that we've always been focused on.
"
Person0,"We would like to thank all of you for joining us today.
"
Person0,"We look forward to sharing next quarter's results with you at the end of next quarter.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
"
