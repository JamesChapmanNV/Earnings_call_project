Person2,"Clearly, we are trading below $10, which kind of puts that on the table.
"
Person2,"We're not at $2 or $3 or $4, which would absolutely put it in front of the table, but that's a decision for the Board.
"
Person2,"We talk about it, if that's something we decide to pursue, we will be transparent with you all going forward.
"

"
Person1,"We haven't seen any dip in terms of lease volume.
"
Person1,"The total square footage leased in the city in 2016 is a little lower than it was in 2015.
"
Person1,"But just like on the lease we just executed with WestRock, we continue to see good opportunities in the best buildings near transit to drive good results.
"
Person1,"In terms of Avalon, usually when we do a building like this, our goal is to be sort of in the 40% to 50% leased range when the building opens, because particularly in a mixed-use environment like Avalon, a lot of it is letting people see it so they can understand the true value offering that we have there.
"
Person1,"And I'm confident we will be in that range by the time we open it.
"
Person1,"The pipeline looks really strong, and we're feeling pretty confident about where 8000 Avalon sits.

"
Person2,"<UNK>, it is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"A lot of the transaction costs went on Parkway's books at or before the time of the merger.
