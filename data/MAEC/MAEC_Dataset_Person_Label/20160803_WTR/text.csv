Person1,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I would expect it will be fairly consistent until the next Pennsylvania rate case.
"
Person2,"And in that Pennsylvania rate case I would see somewhat of a change, not more than a few percentage point, but certainly more than what we have seen recently.
"
Person2,"So I would say fairly steady until we get to that point.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I would say no.
"
Person2,"You know, we're sticking with the guidance that we provided at the Analyst Day that we would like to think of a [disc] sometime in 2017 or 2018 and then a rate increase sometime in 2018 or 2019 and that's still where we see it right now.

Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"The deal pipeline I will tell you is strong, but as you probably are aware, as we think about the discussion with municipals, <UNK>, it's a long lead time and there's a vote and in many occasions we're seeing the need for referendum.
"
Person1,"So I don't see in the coming two quarters a major, that's why we have given the guidance.
"
Person1,"You have seen the guidance, but we have some, I'll call it sizable, opportunities in our pipeline and we have a relatively high level of confidence about some of those.
"
Person1,"So I guess I will leave you with we see activity, we see greater size, and we feel like the pipeline is strong for next year.
"
Person1,"That's -- I think that's fair to say.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much.
"
Person1,"Appreciate your time.
