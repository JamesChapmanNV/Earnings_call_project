Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southside Bancshares First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call.
"
Person0,"We reported first quarter net income of $16.3 million compared to first quarter 2017 net income of $15 million, an 8.4% increase.
"
Person0,"Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $0.46 per share, a decrease of $0.05 or 9.8% compared to $0.51 per share for the same period last year.
"
Person0,"During the first quarter, we experienced only a slight increase in total loans of $15.3 million on a linked-quarter basis due to higher-than-anticipated payoffs.
"
Person0,"When compared to March 31, 2017, total loans increased by $770.7 million or 30.4%.
"
Person0,"Approximately $621.3 million of the annual growth was a result of loans acquired in the acquisition of Diboll State Bancshares last quarter.
"
Person0,"At March 31, 2017, our loans with oil and gas industry exposure remain minimal at 1.66% of our total loan portfolio.
"
Person0,"We recorded loan loss provision expense during the first quarter of $3.7 million, an increase of $2.5 million compared to provision expense recorded in the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"As reported earlier today in our earnings release, the higher first quarter provision expense was a result of 2 commercial real estate loan relationships that were placed on nonaccrual status.
"
Person0,"Nonperforming assets increased to $42.4 million or 0.67% of total assets during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $32 million compared to $10.5 million or 0.16% of total assets at December 31, 2017, and $14.1 million or 0.25% at March 31, 2017.
"
Person0,"Next, for a brief update on our securities portfolio.
"
Person0,"On a linked-quarter basis, the size of the securities portfolio decreased $220.1 million during the first quarter, primarily due to the sales of lower-yielding CMOs and lower-yielding short-duration agency debentures.
"
Person0,"The duration of the securities portfolio at March 31, 2018, increased to 5.3 years from 4.8 years at December 31, 2017, due primarily to the sale of the agency debentures.
"
Person0,"At March 31, 2018, we had a net unrealized loss in the securities portfolio of $48.6 million.
"
Person0,"Primarily as a result of the decrease in the securities portfolio this quarter and the loans acquired last quarter, the mix of our loans and securities increased to a 60/40 mix compared to a 57/43 mix at year-end, and a 52/48 percent mix at March 31, 2017, moving closer to our long-range goal of 70/30.
"
Person0,"During the first quarter, our net interest margin increased 7 basis points to 3.19% and our net interest spread increased 4 basis points to 2.95% on a linked-quarter basis.
"
Person0,"The increase in both the net interest margin and spread were primarily a result of the full quarter of purchase loan accretion from the Diboll portfolio, which positively impacted the average yield on our earning assets.
"
Person0,"We recorded $1.2 million of loan accretion this quarter, higher than we expect on a recurring basis due to the early payoff of 3 purchase impaired loans, resulting in approximately $329,000 of accretion.
"
Person0,"January 1, we adopted the accounting standard related to revenue recognition.
"
Person0,"In connection with the adoption of this guidance, we netted debit card expense of $796,000 previously included in ATM and debit card expense with deposit services income.
"
Person0,"And we also netted brokerage service expense of $151,000 previously included in other noninterest expense with brokerage services income.
"
Person0,"Due to the guidance under the modified retrospective method, prior periods have not been adjusted and are not comparable.
"
Person0,"During the 3 months ended March 31, 2018, our noninterest expense increased $1.7 million or 5.8% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to a full quarter of operational expenses associated with our acquisition late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and several other expense items recorded in the first quarter.
"
Person0,"These additional expenses include acquisition expense of $832,000 in connection with our acquisition last quarter consisting of $652,000 of change in control, payment accruals and severance payments; and the remaining $180,000 included additional professional fees.
"
Person0,"We also paid one-time $1,000 bonuses to certain employees in response to the benefits received from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act totaling $744,000, $249,000 of cost related to the close of a grocery store branch within very close proximity of the branch acquired in the Diboll acquisition, and $827,000 of losses on the sale of securities in the first quarter.
"
Person0,"Our amortization expense increased due to the additional intangible assets recorded last quarter in connection with the acquisition and a full quarter of amortization compared to only 1 month recorded in the fourth quarter related to the additional intangible assets.
"
Person0,"On a linked-quarter basis, our efficiency ratio increased for the 3 months ended March 31, 2018, up 1.86% to 51.28% for the first quarter of 2018 from 49.42% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and decreased from 51.60% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
"
Person0,"We expect to see additional efficiencies in future quarters as we complete the integration in Diboll.
"
Person0,"The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 11.4%.
"
Person0,"We recorded a discrete tax credit of $88,000 associated with equity awards that decreased the rate by 48 basis points.
"
Person0,"At this point, we expect an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 12%.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much, and I will now turn the call over to <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Overall, we experienced a good first quarter.
"
Person1,"Our net interest margin increased 7 basis points and our efficiency ratio decreased compared to the first quarter of 2017, despite the significant reduction in the corporate tax rate that negatively impacted both.
"
Person1,"As <UNK> reported, provision expense and nonperforming loans increased during the first quarter.
"
Person1,"This was driven by 2 commercial real estate loan relationships, one of which was an acquired loan relationship in our 2014 acquisition.
"
Person1,"We are not wavering on our underwriting standards, and we believe our asset quality remains solid.
"
Person1,"This last weekend, we completed the core conversion related to the Diboll State Bancshares acquisition.
"
Person1,"We are pleased at how smooth and seamless the integration has gone.
"
Person1,"With the integration now virtually complete, we expect to realize additional synergies and cost savings.
"
Person1,"Diboll's outstanding acquired deposit franchise was a significant factor in the linked-quarter improvement in net interest margin and spread.
"
Person1,"The decrease in the securities portfolio during the first quarter, mostly to sale of lower-yielding securities, provides additional balance sheet flexibility in this higher interest rate environment.
"
Person1,"This additional flexibility and the resulting increase in loans as a percentage of earning assets to 60%, combined with the Diboll-acquired core deposit franchise, should enhance our future NIM prospects as the anticipated Fed interest rate increases occur.
"
Person1,"We will continue to focus on cost containment and process improvement in an effort to further improve our efficiency ratio.
"
Person1,"At this point, we believe the 2 areas that will yield the greatest future efficiencies are further process automation and continued rightsizing of our branches.
"
Person1,"Economic conditions in the Texas markets we serve remain healthy.
"
Person1,"The Austin and DFW markets, fueled primarily by ongoing job growth and company relocations, continued to perform exceptionally well.
"
Person1,"We are excited about our prospects for 2018 given the completed integration of the newly-acquired balance sheet, benefits associated with reduced corporate tax rates, the dynamic markets we serve, our solid balance sheet, strong capital position and outstanding team members.
"
Person1,"At this time, we will conclude the prepared remarks and open the lines for your questions.
"
Person1,"They basically -- the 2 facilities just have not leased up as anticipated.
"
Person1,"They are continuing to lease up, but they're not at the stage where they thought they'd be at this point in time.
"
Person1,"So we felt it appropriate to go ahead and place them on nonaccrual and put some reserve against them.
"
Person1,"But they are continuing to show some improvement on a quarterly basis, and that's why we said we'd reevaluate that on a quarterly basis.
"
Person1,"Our pipeline looks healthy.
"
Person1,"The issue is we continue to see some payoffs that are going to be coming down the road in the next several quarters.
"
Person1,"Some of the construction projects have completed and some of those are going on the market.
"
Person1,"So the pipeline is healthy, but we do anticipate some further drag as a result of payoffs.
"
Person1,"I'd like to think that the mid-single digit is still achievable.
"
Person1,"Instead of 7, it may be closer to 5.
"
Person1,"But we do have a healthy pipeline.
"
Person1,"We do have some construction loans that are going to continue -- starting to fund up right now.
"
Person1,"So there are a lot of positive things that are happening and it really just depends, <UNK>, on the level of payoffs that we see during the year.
"
Person0,"Well, if we look at the reclasses that we had, we had estimated around 32 for the run rate.
"
Person0,"And if you take all the noise out, we would come out about 30.
"
Person0,"And with the reclass, the expenses that we reclassed that to deposit services income that I mentioned, we would have been around $30,789,000.
"
Person0,"And that include the onetime bonuses that was around $744,000 and a branch closure, so right there is $1 million.
"
Person0,"We're thinking -- we talked a little bit about that yesterday, 30 to 31, probably.
"
Person0,"And we would expect it to go down further as the year progresses, probably more in the third quarter even.
"
Person0,"We'll have some expense related this next -- in the second quarter probably to conversion, additional travel and dissolve the expenses that come along with that function.
"
Person0,"So we're thinking somewhere in the 30.8 range to 31 probably.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"There was a new accounting pronouncement that allowed us to transfer some things -- transfer anything out of HTM that we wanted to AFS.
"
Person1,"And we felt like with the changing interest rate environment, it made sense for us to move some of -- a lot of those items out of HTM to AFS so that we can restructure the securities portfolio as we deem appropriate in this higher interest rate environment right now.
"
Person1,"So that's what drove that.
"
Person1,"And basically, we transferred 700 -- about $740 million in securities out of HTM to -- and they were all callable securities, out of HTM to AFS.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I think it's more of a wait and see in case -- depending on the interest rate environment.
"
Person1,"We're actually glad to see interest rates move up.
"
Person1,"And that's one of the reasons we sold a lot of securities, and about half of that was in the first month of this first quarter.
"
Person1,"So we do feel like we have a lot of additional flexibility and we're going to continue to look at potential restructuring going forward.
"
Person1,"The geography of the other CRE loan is in Little Rock.
"
Person1,"It\
"
Person1,"That is correct.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Just one second, I'm -- <UNK>, we're going to have to get you that number.
"
Person1,"It's not that significant.
"
Person1,"There's not a lot of it.
"
Person1,"And that particular loan is $13 million.
"
Person0,"I do.
"
Person0,"I was looking at the Omni accretion, and it's gone down but it's pretty flat the last 3 quarters.
"
Person0,"It went -- it only went down around $9,000 this quarter from the fourth quarter, so I expect it to trickle down a little bit more.
"
Person0,"But overall, I do think between $8,000 and $9,000.
"
Person0,"There will be the payoffs and there's just no way to predict those at this point.
"
Person0,"Well, at any point, actually.
"
Person0,"But I do think that's reasonable.
"
Person1,"I do.
"
Person1,"I think there is potential for some additional lift, especially given the fact that the fed is planning on raising interest rates at least 2 more times this year.
"
Person0,"Well, the total was around, let's see, $800,000 -- $950,000.
"
Person0,"$796,000 was related to debit card and $151,000 was related to brokerage services.
"
Person0,"So our deposit service still increased if you look at the year-over-year, and that's the result of having the acquisition largely.
"
Person0,"And then the brokerage services, even with the net -- you will notice a decrease because of the netting.
"
Person0,"But if you add back the $151,000 essentially to that, you all see an increase because the prior periods do not have it netted out.
"
Person0,"And that should be fairly -- I would expect that to be fairly consistent.
"
Person0,"This was our first full quarter with Diboll activity in it.
"
Person0,"We just had 1 month of activity in the fourth quarter, so probably we'll be able to have a better feel for what that run rate on the debit card expense will be after another quarter.
"
Person1,"The magnitude of the payoffs.
"
Person1,"Gosh, I'd have to go back to fourth quarter and see what payoffs were then.
"
Person1,"But I do think we did experience higher payoffs this quarter than we did in the fourth quarter and certainly, higher than what we had in the third quarter last year.
"
Person1,"But I'd have to go back and check the exact dollar amounts.
"
Person1,"It really is hard to determine.
"
Person1,"Most of the 2 markets that we've lent a lot of money into, the Austin and the DFW markets, continue to be very, very healthy and there's a lot of continued sales of different properties that take place.
"
Person1,"And as I tell the loan officers we agonize over are they going to pay off, and then we get upset when they do pay off.
"
Person1,"So it's just part of a healthy economy, I think, that we are experiencing payoffs.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"We believe Southside is well positioned for the future, and look forward to reporting the results for the remainder of 2018.
"
Person1,"Thank you for being on the call today, and we look forward to hosting our next earnings call in July.
