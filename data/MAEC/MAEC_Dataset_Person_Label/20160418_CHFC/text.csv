Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"No, I would say not.
"
Person1,"We went through that period of time where there was some concern about it -- about a considerable decrease in interest rates.
"
Person1,"I think the market responded appropriately from that standpoint, and I don't see any headwind from this point in time, from a Michigan economy standpoint.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"It will.
"
Person2,"Oh, that's a great question.
"
Person2,"I haven't got to that much specificity yet.
"
Person2,"So, we'll have to -- that will have to be something that we'll look into as we get closer to the date.
"
Person2,"But I wouldn't think that -- my knowledge of Talmer -- it's not going to -- it's going to be 30%-plus.
"
Person2,"So, obviously, it's got to be between 30% and 35%, so in that 30%-plus.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, you didn't have enough.
"
Person2,"You mean as far as the one-time acquisition transaction expenses.
"
Person2,"Oh, gosh.
"
Person2,"Well, we've estimated collectively $62 million.
"
Person2,"Those will get split between the two of us.
"
Person2,"You'll see a measurable amount next quarter as we continue through the process.
"
Person2,"But I would say the majority of them will come in the quarter that we close, and the immediate subsequent quarter after that.
"
Person2,"(Multiple speakers) So, you [won't] see the majority of that in the second quarter.
"
Person2,"Yes, 50 -- I mean, when we were doing the modeling process, our models had them about 50/50.
"
Person2,"Now, that doesn't mean it won't be 40/60, right.
"
Person2,"But it won't be 30/70.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Cynthia.
"
Person1,"And thank you for the questions.
"
Person1,"Again, we appreciate your time and interest in Chemical Financial Corporation.
"
Person1,"We remain confident in our prospects going forward, by making Chemical Bank the community-oriented financial institution of choice in the markets we serve, and seeking to partner with like-minded institutions in the Midwest.
"
Person1,"We believe we are well positioned to achieve additional competitive and acquisitive market share gains as we move forward.
"
Person1,"Thank you again, and have a great day.
"
