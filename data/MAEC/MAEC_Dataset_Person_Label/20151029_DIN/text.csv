Person0,"<UNK>, I am so glad you asked that question, because I get to tell you, it is everywhere.
"
Person0,"It's breakfast, it's lunch, it's dinner, it's late-night.
"
Person0,"It's every daypart, it's throughout the day.
"
Person0,"It is everything at IHOP.
"
Person0,"It is sales, it is traffic, it is all doing extremely well.
"
Person0,"Across the country, across the board, I would call it an A-plus-plus.
"
Person0,"Yes, I may not have been clear in prior calls.
"
Person0,"That is a three-year commitment.
"
Person0,"It is all of 2015, it's all of 2016, and it's all of 2017.
"
Person0,"It is the same increase for three years.
"
Person0,"Yes, I have answered this question before, and I know this probably frustrates everyone.
"
Person0,"We don't see a real difference in our sales or traffic driven by the competitive set.
"
Person0,"The large majority of the category is independents.
"
Person0,"And the truth of the matter is, when we steal share, we are going to steal share from largely the independents.
"
Person0,"We don't see a lot of shift one way or the other because a competitor went on television and said something or drove a price point.
"
Person0,"That is not really what our nemesis is, or our focus.
"
Person0,"It is really us differentiating ourselves in the category.
"
Person0,"What our consumers tell us is they see in general in the casual dining category a lot of sameness, and our whole focus is really on differentiating ourselves from everyone else in the category.
"
Person0,"And that is what I was speaking to earlier.
"
Person0,"This notion of being bigger and bolder is really focused on, once and for all, just separating us from the entire category.
"
Person0,"That is what we are really seeing.
"
Person0,"It is not anything that is particularly a price point or a promotion.
"
Person0,"That is just not what we are seeing at all.
"
Person0,"And that hasn't been for some time.
"
Person0,"That has really not been our issue.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Great question.
"
Person0,"It is a couple of very specific things.
"
Person0,"One is a very focused management team and a very focused group of franchisees who don't try to do 20 things, but do a couple things outstanding.
"
Person0,"That is the focus we've had at IHOP.
"
Person0,"That is the focus we are going to get at Applebee's.
"
Person0,"That is number one.
"
Person0,"Number two is, it is not any one thing.
"
Person0,"It is all of those things in combination.
"
Person0,"So it's the effort on operations, this incredible maniacal focus on advertising.
"
Person0,"It's focus on innovation.
"
Person0,"It's doing all those things simultaneously.
"
Person0,"It's not sequential.
"
Person0,"It's doing them at at once and getting maniacally focused on doing a couple of things well.
"
Person0,"I never want to underestimate the power of the execution on the IHOP side and doing that same execution on the Applebee's side.
"
Person0,"And quite candidly, there is a huge advantage on the Applebee's side.
"
Person0,"It is not 365 franchisees like it is on the IHOP side.
"
Person0,"It's 33 franchisees who own all the restaurants in the domestic US and getting them maniacally focused.
"
Person0,"And the great news is I couldn't be more complementary of the work, the effort and the commitment these franchisees have to do whatever it takes to break out of the mold.
"
Person0,"And that is the best news of the day.
"
Person0,"I just literally came from being with all of them in Miami, Florida, and they are maniacally focused on doing just that.
"
Person0,"So that is the best news of the day.
"
Person0,"Thanks, operator, and thank you all for joining us today.
"
Person0,"We are scheduled to report the fourth quarter on February 24.
"
Person0,"If you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to call myself or <UNK> or <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thanks again.
"
