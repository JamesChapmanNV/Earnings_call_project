Person,Sentence
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"You've got two items outside of that.
"
Person2,"You are right on the natural acceleration.
"
Person2,"We believe it's there.
"
Person2,"We do have the term fees that we've talked about, so you've got that captured correctly.
"
Person2,"The cost actions, we've taken some cost actions in Q1.
"
Person2,"You saw some further cost actions in Q2.
"
Person2,"To the extent we don't see the sales execution that we're looking for, we'll potentially take further cost actions.
"
Person2,"We have other levers within our cost structure that could help us continue to make sure we maintain the profitability guidance, <UNK>, and protect the profitability guidance that we give in the market place.
"
Person2,"Those are the three big ones.
"
Person2,"The fourth would be back to our contract delay.
"
Person2,"We've got some milestones that we'll meet in the back half of the year on one of those larger deals that will drive some incremental earnings per share, as well.
"
Person2,"If you add the four of those together, that is the bridge to the back half of the year.
"
Person2,"It is a steep curve, but we're pleased with first -- I mean second quarter, as we saw a little bit of the flattening of that curve as we brought some extra EPS into the quarter.
"
Person1,"We've also got a number of key deals, <UNK>, that we've signed.
"
Person1,"As you know, given the nature of our long-term revenue streams, and the high re-occurring revenue, our deals that we sign also take often times a number of months, or even greater than a year to on-board.
"
Person1,"You're seeing some of those large deals that we've signed historically that we've talked about come on line.
"
Person1,"You can start seeing that in some of the numbers we've actually disclosed for IFS, et cetera, where we've got some large core banking deals that have been coming on.
"
Person1,"All of those things, to <UNK>'s point, the levers that help us control our expense line and profitability line, and also just new sales and the on-boarding, the prior sales all give us some confidence going into the back half.
"
Person2,"Actually, some of the term fees we've already been notified on, <UNK>, but they are waiting regulatory approval.
"
Person2,"You've got an idea in working with the customer as to when the big conversion time horizon would be, and when you would actually see them go away.
"
Person2,"We do have some visibility into those term fees already.
"
Person2,"Your point is valid.
"
Person2,"On others we don't have every dollar lined up, or have been notified on every dollar.
"
Person2,"But we do have pretty visibility into a large chunk of those based on the conversion time frame that the customer's looking at.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"As you mentioned, these termination fees are strictly related to financial institutions getting acquired or consolidating.
"
Person1,"To <UNK>'s point, we have to be given -- we're given notice, because we've got work to do to help them de-convert as they move on to their acquiring platform, which is the typical situation.
"
Person1,"We've had some situations where it's come the opposite direction, and we've discussed on prior calls.
"
Person1,"But we get some pretty good visibility.
"
Person1,"Typically, this is something that can get modeled pretty easily.
"
Person1,"What we were surprised by in the first half of the year is that we didn't get that notification -- which as we've said now multiple times, that's a great outcome for the Company, because we're retaining a very profitable client that's going to be buying more products and services from us.
"
Person1,"Yes, we've actually gotten some great response through that acquisition.
"
Person1,"As always, we put forward a very aggressive pro forma around growth as we accelerate it through our sales engine.
"
Person1,"We also put always an aggressive target, to make sure we get the synergies necessary as we put -- integrate these companies into our Company.
"
Person1,"I will tell you, we're right on plan for both of those.
"
Person1,"Pipeline's very strong, good deal closures quarter in, quarter out.
"
Person1,"Response from the clients have been very positive.
"
Person1,"As we talked about when we did that acquisition, one of the things that resonated us most with Clear2Pay, especially with their open-payment framework, was the fact that they were already penetrating many of the tier ones through a single payment type around the world.
"
Person1,"What the opportunity there is you penetrate with a particular payment type, say ACH, and then you come in and you add wires.
"
Person1,"You add other types through the open-payment framework.
"
Person1,"We're very pleased with his acquisition at this point.
"
Person1,"It's integrated very cleanly into the Company.
"
Person1,"GFS has done a good job of accelerating the product growth rate by putting it through our sales engine.
"
Person1,"Right now it's still early, but we would say we're very pleased.
"
Person1,"Yes, no it's a good point.
"
Person1,"It is part of the investment.
"
Person1,"We feel very good about our deal closure.
"
Person1,"Year to date, frankly, when we look at total contract value on a new total contract value, we're up 10% over 2014 at this point in time.
"
Person1,"Frankly, if you adjust it for currency, that's greater than that gross around 15%, so we feel very good about it.
"
Person1,"From that standpoint, our pipeline's very strong, and we're opportunistic of opportunities.
"
Person1,"As I've said on multiple calls, <UNK>, I look for deal-flow through a pipeline.
"
Person1,"You're not going to be able to sign them all, but are we having really good deal churn, and are we making sure that our sales teams are re-filling that pipeline.
"
Person1,"I would tell you we're seeing that.
"
Person1,"As I said, the results are showing that we're up year to date against this time last year on new sales, and frankly, across both groups.
"
Person1,"All in all, we're pleased with the results, and pleased with the investment, and we've highlighted a number of those sales.
"
Person1,"When we bring a sale forward in our prepared remarks, keep in mind these are large multi-million-dollar engagements.
"
Person1,"The team's doing a nice job.
"
Person2,"If you remember in my prepared remarks, we sold a small investment.
"
Person2,"It ended up being about $7 million in there, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"That was -- the other's just normal noise in there, but $7 million was a small investment gain.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"Yes, we would still say that's exactly where we think we're going to land, still in that 5% to 7% range, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Given what we've done to date and talked about the back half of the year it may trend towards the lower end of that, but still in that 5% to 7% range.
"
Person2,"Yes, I think it's still there.
"
Person1,"Well, to answer your question on the first part about the multi-billion-dollar financial institutions and signing those large deals, are there others in the pipeline.
"
Person1,"The answer is yes.
"
Person1,"I think what you've seen over the last several years is we've consistently executed on those.
"
Person1,"I'll go back to [Anumpla].
"
Person1,"I'll go back to the Citi announcement.
"
Person1,"All of these are big engagements with very large multi-engagements.
"
Person1,"CIT last quarter.
"
Person1,"If you think about it, we continue to sign and close very nice transactions in that size.
"
Person1,"If you look in GFS, Credit Agricole is a great example where we started with a consulting engagement.
"
Person1,"It's led to a professional services engagement.
"
Person1,"We're now engaging around the product side.
"
Person1,"Good growth of the way we think that GFS will head in the way we -- investments we've made.
"
Person1,"There's other large deals in the pipeline that we continue to pursue.
"
Person1,"Of course we don't sign them all, right.
"
Person1,"But that goes back to my deal flow comment in the earlier question.
"
Person1,"All in all, we are pleased with the size of institutions we're sign.
"
Person1,"We're pleased with -- we're starting to see product pull-through in the GFS organization, and IFS continues to execute very effectively.
"
Person1,"Thanks Darren.
"
Person2,"Yes, I think fourth quarter typically if you map out the path has a little bit of a higher growth rate as the institutions are working through their capital planning and capital budgeting process.
"
Person2,"We do see them flushing some capital budgets in the fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"That's historic, in terms of both IFS and GFS.
"
Person2,"You will see a little bit of a ramp there.
"
Person1,"Also to add on that, your always see nice transaction spikes in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season.
"
Person2,"That's exactly right.
"
Person2,"You will see a little bit higher in the fourth, but that's more normal trend line, if you will, there.
"
Person2,"Beyond that, we don't have a significant other transaction change or volume change that we haven't already discussed in terms of either term fees or sales execution.
"
Person2,"IFS really has very little, if any, currency impact in it.
"
Person2,"Nothing there in terms of that constant currency.
"
Person2,"Then you can back-math where we are, where we're going to be sort of 5% to 7% in the aggregate, for the full year, what we've got through the first half of the year, at about 3.2% for the quarter.
"
Person2,"You can back-math it and see what your models say.
"
Person2,"It will be some of both, because some of the term fees are flowing through IFS.
"
Person2,"We're getting over some of the comps that we've talked about.
"
Person2,"Then GFS would also have some acceleration of the deals we've talked about signing.
"
Person2,"Yes, we've outlined -- we've talked about full year we thought we would have about $50 million.
"
Person2,"In the first half of the year we've had about $11 million, so very small.
"
Person2,"We do anticipate term fees to be much more significant in the back half of the year.
"
Person2,"I can't reiterate this enough.
"
Person2,"I know you guys are looking quarter to quarter.
"
Person2,"I can't reiterate this enough that lower term fees is a good thing for us long term.
"
Person2,"We maintain the customer relationship, we cross-sell, we up-sell, and we keep the profitability line.
"
Person2,"I think last year was about $20 million, with a full year 2014 of about $75 million.
"
Person1,"But as we said earlier in another question, you just can't predict when these things are going to happen.
"
Person1,"M&A is going to -- consolidation is going to occur at different times, and so there's always lumpiness around these kind of fees.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"Thank you for your questions today and for your continued interest in FIS.
"
Person1,"I'd like to summarize by saying we continue to deliver revenue growth fueled by significant re-occurring revenue streams, with industry-leading margins and strong sales results.
"
Person1,"We are pleased with our recent restructuring and re-segmentation of our business, which has allowed us to align our services and solution portfolio to address clients' unique business challenges.
