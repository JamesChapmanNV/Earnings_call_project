Person1,"<UNK>, this is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I'll take those questions in order.
"
Person1,"First of all, the recovery of the $13 million, we'll see an increase in revenue for that amount, and you'll see an offsetting increase in expense or amortization.
"
Person1,"We'll report it as an operating expense as we amortize the deferred balance.
"
Person1,"So the net-net, it will be a positive cash flow perspective but net zero from an income or net income perspective.
"
Person1,"Now, we're collecting the $13 million, which has been authorized.
"
Person1,"This is not something that's subject to refunds.
"
Person1,"This is something that we're collecting, amortizing those balances.
"
Person1,"Any adjustments to collections of deferred balances would be done on a prospective basis as we go through each calendar year.
"
Person0,"Once it gets put into the PGA, we're collecting it.
"
Person0,"Those are dollars that have been approved for collection by the Commission and there's no second look at it.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think maybe a couple of things to be helpful here.
"
Person1,"Gill Ranch, we had about $1.8 million recorded last year on the storage segment which increased Gill Ranch's O&M, which we wouldn't expect to be repeated this year, or as something that would be recurring.
"
Person1,"As we think about O&M more generally, we have implemented cost control to try to offset some of the impact of weather and the write-off, frankly, coming off 2014, which was actually a pretty, we had a pretty low level of O&M expense that year based on FTEs and so forth.
"
Person1,"So we're coming off a pretty low base.
"
Person1,"From a budgeting perspective we actually expected to be up fairly significantly year-over-year, in the 7% area.
"
Person1,"And the fact that we have held it to relatively close to flat year-over-year is acknowledgment of the efforts that we've taken this year, which are probably not sustainable next year.
"
Person1,"At some point we have to have, we have to adjust staffing.
"
Person1,"We have to reflect increases in costs that are baked into third party expenditures and other things.
"
Person1,"So I would say if you look at our, if you look year-over-year, if you take our O&M of 121 that's reported year-to-date, and we adjust out of that the about $16 million in the write-off, the environmental write-off and other adjustments, and then if we look at some of the baked-in increases that we had to offset, which included the bargaining unit, labor increases, and compensation increases, again we have kept that flat relative to last year.
"
Person1,"So that, in total, that gets you somewhere in the $4 million plus area in terms of savings that we have been able to achieve, which are baked into our forecast numbers.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Okay, doesn't seem to be any additional questions.
"
Person0,"I want to end by thanking you all again for joining us this morning and for your interest in our company.
"
Person0,"We appreciate it.
"
Person0,"Take care.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
