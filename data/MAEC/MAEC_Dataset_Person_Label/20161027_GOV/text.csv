Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"They were up.
"
Person1,"They were a bit higher this quarter.
"
Person1,"I think it was a few things that drove that, some of it one-time items such as cyclical painting for a couple of tenants, as well as just we had an increase in salaries and benefits expense over the prior year, where we had a number of open positions.
"
Person1,"But we'd expect growth in other operating expenses to moderate in the fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"For the year, we've done a pretty good job managing expenses.
"
Person1,"Total operating expenses on a same-property basis are up only 1.7% through the first three quarters.
"
Person1,"So we've been fairly successful in managing that, and I'd expect growth in operating expenses to moderate in the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, we don't anticipate that would have any impact for us.
"
Person0,"We have one building leased to the FBI in Stafford, Virginia.
"
Person0,"It's the headquarters for the Behavioral Analysis Unit.
"
Person0,"They need to be near Quantico, and we're right across the entrance from Quantico.
"
Person0,"So we feel pretty good about that particular location and don't think we'll be impacted.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, I think it's an accurate statement.
"
Person0,"I mean, the US government in particular tends to pay higher rents than private-sector tenants.
"
Person0,"Part of that's due to their security requirements.
"
Person0,"We also tend to have slightly higher tenant improvement costs with non-government tenants, which generally is just an upgrade to the quality of the tenant build-out.
"
Person0,"That is why you see us very focused on trying to renew government tenants in place and backfilling vacant space with government tenants versus private-sector tenants.
"
Person0,"I think -- it's a good question, <UNK>, and I'll give you my opinion.
"
Person0,"It's always hard to know exactly where things stand, because this has become very political.
"
Person0,"I think on the one hand, Congress will continue to focus on increasing utilization rates and trying to save as much money as they can in leasing real estate.
"
Person0,"With that said, I think the vast majority of buildings around the country that are occupied by GSA-related agencies are meeting or have met their utilization rates.
"
Person0,"So I think we're in certainly the latter half, maybe the seventh inning, of government right-sizing their space.
"
Person0,"We're working on leasing plans, and we've had some showings on both of those spaces.
"
Person0,"We are also taking a hard look at whether we think it makes sense to own those buildings long term or go ahead and move them out as dispositions.
"
Person0,"So we may have an update for you on the next earnings call, but we're thinking through both of those strategies right now, <UNK>, to see what makes the most sense for the Company.
"
Person0,"Thank you for joining us this morning.
"
Person0,"<UNK> and I will be at the NAREIT conference in November and hope to see many of you there.
"
Person0,"Operator, that concludes our call.
