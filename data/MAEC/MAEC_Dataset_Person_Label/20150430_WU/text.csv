Person,Sentence
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person2,"Let me start, and see if this answers your question.
"
Person2,"The hedges that we had this quarter, we had a gain of $16 million on our hedges.
"
Person2,"That helped our revenue line.
"
Person2,"That also helped our profit line.
"
Person2,"That helped margins by about 100 basis points, margin percentage.
"
Person2,"However, the currency translation on our revenue and profits, the impact of margins from that translation largely offset the margin benefit that we had from the hedges.
"
Person2,"Currency impact in total was net neutral on the margins in the first quarter.
"
Person2,"What you're actually seeing come through in the margin improvement is the net benefit of the cost savings initiatives, offset slightly by the higher compliance costs in the quarter.
"
Person2,"Well, the cost savings are things that we already have under way.
"
Person2,"The compliance costs will vary from quarter to quarter.
"
Person2,"But those are the two impacts that are showing up in the first quarter.
"
Person2,"Obviously the currency impacts will be potentially different each quarter, and it's based on where currency rates are ultimately, on how that equation will play out.
"
Person2,"No, it's -- we did anticipate it.
"
Person2,"We had planned on making price changes in our DMT business.
"
Person2,"Even during the course of last year, you recall, <UNK>, that we've been telling you that the cross-border environment has been quite stable.
"
Person2,"Having said that, we always look at our 16,000 corridors.
"
Person2,"We do price increases in some parts.
"
Person2,"We do price decreases.
"
Person2,"There's a balance of both of those things that are going on in the world.
"
Person2,"But generally, we haven't seen a big need for large pricing in the cross-border business.
"
Person2,"We knew and have in our outlook the planned pricing in our DMT business.
"
Person1,"Also, putting in perspective <UNK>, the DMT prices -- as you know, it's only for certain bents, and it's only for certain parts of the country where we feel competitive pressure.
"
Person1,"It's like a street corp in our pricing, which we were doing earlier.
"
Person1,"We always choose pricing actions, if we do that, except the 2012 one, one-time correction.
"
Person1,"We always do in a very intelligent way looking at the corridors and where the competition is, where to do it.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we are very focused on optimizing our compliance programs.
"
Person2,"In the short term, and it's still the short term, we have had to hire a significant number of people in the compliance organization, now over 2,000 people.
"
Person2,"That was more than 60% of the cost in the first quarter on the compliance number.
"
Person2,"But we also are continuing to invest in technology and automation of our processes.
"
Person2,"Over the long term, I do believe that we'll be able to optimize our compliance spend.
"
Person2,"I don't see it really stepping down from where we are in the near future, because the regulatory environment continues to evolve, and it is complex, and it's a global effort.
"
Person2,"I see us --I think we are at a more stable place in the current range that we have for this year.
"
Person2,"But our goal is always to optimize (inaudible, multiple speaker) --
"
Person1,"I really believe that it will differentiate us to be partnered with different parts of the world.
"
Person1,"I think it's an investment that makes it Western Union special, that makes it Western Union to apply in different parts of the world with the regulations.
"
Person1,"I believe it's a competitive advantage long term.
"
Person1,"We always raise prices or decrease prices different parts of the world.
"
Person1,"We even change bands within the price within the 16,000 corridors.
"
Person1,"That's a part of the business.
"
Person1,"We have been doing it for many years.
"
Person1,"That's about -- it's nothing that big price actions that we're going to change our pricing strategy for a certain time for near term.
"
Person1,"Just to clarify, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"In the first quarter the domestic money transfer pricing wasn't in place yet, so we didn't have that impact on pricing.
"
Person2,"Not by quarter, but we are still expecting about $70-million benefit on the hedges for the full year.
"
Person2,"That can vary a little bit depending on where rates, currency rates, are.
"
Person2,"But yes, still expecting about $70 million.
"
Person2,"We've assumed -- just so you know -- we've assumed about $1.10 euro rate.
"
Person2,"Obviously that continues to fluctuate around.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Laura, I understand that's the end of the queue.
"
Person0,"We want to thank everybody for joining the call today, and wish you a good afternoon.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
