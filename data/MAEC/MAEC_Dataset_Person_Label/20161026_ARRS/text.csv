Person1,"Yes, I don't know if we can give you a lot more color on that, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"At a broad stroke, you are not --
"
Person2,"So, <UNK>, what we have said is that both the access business and the CMTS businesses are big businesses, and they are, and really we haven't gone much further than that.
"
Person1,"I don't know, <UNK>, what do you think.
"
Person1,"I don't -- my sense is there wasn't much of a change there, but --
"
Person3,"No, I would say more broadly just the continued investment around next-generation entertainment experiences was probably the larger factor versus Rio specifically.
"
Person3,"And certainly, many of the service provider customers that we work with put programs and marketing campaigns around the Olympics and the viewing experience that they can get, but I don't know that that unto itself was a big item in the quarter.
"
Person2,"Well, it sounds like when you were doing your math, you were only considering Comcast, and, of course, we have added Charter to the mix.
"
Person2,"I suspect that's part of it.
"
Person2,"And, of course, as the share value changes from the point of time where we -- from inception, that really does change the Black Scholes value of it.
"
Person2,"So, many things to the puzzle, but it sounds like you might be not considering the Charter piece, Kyle.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, welcome to the (multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"Glad to hear you on the call.
"
Person1,"So, <UNK>, maybe I will make a few comments.
"
Person1,"You can jump in.
"
Person1,"So on the ramp, it depends a lot on the timing of the announcement.
"
Person1,"There are some times we will announce something and we are still in development, and there is other times the announcement is concurrent with launching and deploying.
"
Person1,"So, it is a little hard to put a complete finger on it, but usually there is a lag of some sort, <UNK>, right, between an announcement and actual deployment of some sort, right, but it's usually within a six-month period or something like that.
"
Person1,"DOCSIS 3.1, if you want to answer that, clearly there is a cycle ahead of us there.
"
Person3,"Yes, so we view DOCSIS 3.1 as being, I will say, the next big -- at least from a CPE broadband perspective, the next big DOCSIS upgrade cycle, and while we have talked about initial product certifications and some early shipments, we think there is a broader transition or migration that is going to happen throughout, starting maybe in earnest in 2017, but certainly well into 2018 as well.
"
Person3,"I view it similar to the DOCSIS 2 to DOCSIS 3 migration in some respects, although 3.0 had a number of upgrades buried in it unto itself.
"
Person3,"But we view that transition happening, and also I would point out that Wi-Fi is closely coupled in there as well in terms of we're seeing upgrades take place now to introduce the latest in Wi-Fi technologies, and I think that gets coupled in with the 3.1 rollout that we expect to see in 2017 and 2018.
"
Person1,"Okay, great.
"
Person1,"Well, we just want to thank everyone for joining.
"
Person1,"I know it is a busy season, so taking the time, we really appreciate it.
"
Person1,"Lots of good questions.
"
Person1,"Look forward to seeing you at some of these upcoming events, and if not, maybe at CES in Vegas in January.
"
Person1,"So, thank you.
"
Person0,"Thanks, everyone.
"
Person0,"That concludes our call.
