Person1,"It does include the product from Kanjoya.
"
Person1,"Vestrics is more inside the system.
"
Person1,"But no -- couldn't be happier with the people, with what they've produced, and they've become family in a very short period of time.
"
Person1,"And they've contributed, in the very short period of time we've rolled out, especially the Kanjoya product, in a very short period of time.
"
Person1,"So, can't imagine how we could be happier with it.
"
Person1,"When I said 10% back to the base, that includes managed services.
"
Person1,"So, it's about -- probably about 5% of our revenue is managed services.
"
Person1,"It's the same solution.
"
Person1,"The sale is pretty much -- it is exactly the same sale if you're selling someone with 150 or 450.
"
Person1,"Pricing is the same.
"
Person1,"We have 36 quota carriers in the United States right now, on it.
"
Person1,"So, yes.
"
Person1,"I think it's just about getting the organization in shape, so when we add people, we have the right infrastructure in place, both in sales and implementation, and in service.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I haven't heard any differences.
"
Person1,"I think, if you just want a very high level -- I think in Strategic and Mid-<UNK>et, we get attached two-thirds of the time, with most of our major products.
"
Person1,"And in the Enterprise, it is about 50% of the time.
"
Person1,"I think the reason is, that a lot of times down low -- down lower, they're not using anything, so we have a better chance of selling them the whole unified suite, where, up top, they could be using something else.
"
Person1,"I think that's difference between two-thirds and one-half attach rates between the different organizations.
"
Person1,"Remember, we're replacing -- like if you're replacing time and attendance, the time and attendance vendor generally doesn't have performance or recruiting --
"
Person1,"But the nature of it is you're replacing two.
"
Person1,"At that, and maybe if you're replacing performance, and succession, and recruiting, maybe it's one vendor.
"
Person1,"But once you get into time, it has to be another vendor.
"
Person1,"Now with the Kanjoya product, that would have to be -- well, not sure how many people have that.
"
Person1,"But, yes, I don't really think of it that way, just think of the attach rates.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Well, I don't think -- we went to -- we got to $36, fairly quickly.
"
Person1,"I'm actually -- it gave us the opportunity with the $36 to hit our numbers by increasing their quotas.
"
Person1,"As I mentioned last quarter, rather than going from a freshman quota to a sophomore quota, we took them from a freshman quota to a senior quota.
"
Person1,"So, we were able to get the quota that we had confidence in, that they could achieve.
"
Person1,"So it kind of like moved the hiring -- I thought we would be hiring more people in Strategic this year, but I don't need to, don't have to.
"
Person1,"And I think it's better for the organization to build a better foundation there, and then start hiring for people who come in the beginning of 2018.
"
Person1,"Again, not for the 2018 year, more for the 2019 year.
"
Person1,"Because, I think the team we have in place now has the ability to achieve what we need to achieve, well, certainly this year, and then next year.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"<UNK> it is a tough comp in Q1, if you go back to last year.
"
Person0,"Again, we did sell some ACA back to the base that kicked in, in Q4 of 2015, and rolled into Q1, so that's a little bit faster than normal when we sell something new.
"
Person0,"So that created the tough compare.
"
Person1,"It's sometime the second half of this year, is the plan.
"
Person1,"Now, we don't know if that's going to actually happen, because it could move.
"
Person1,"But right now, it's something the second half of this year.
"
Person1,"We did not put in the numbers for this year, in case it does not go live, and it moves to January 1, 2018.
"
Person1,"So it is not in our numbers.
"
Person1,"Once it goes live, in -- if it does go January 2018 instead of Q3 or Q4 of this year, it will not be material to the quarters.
"
Person1,"It just will not.
"
Person1,"It will not be our largest account.
"
Person1,"In revenue.
"
Person1,"It will not be our largest revenue account.
"
Person1,"Okay, thank you.
"
Person1,"Thanks for your time.
"
Person1,"Appreciate it.
"
Person1,"Looking forward to a great 2017.
"
Person1,"And congratulations to all you Pats fans.
"
Person1,"Good night.
