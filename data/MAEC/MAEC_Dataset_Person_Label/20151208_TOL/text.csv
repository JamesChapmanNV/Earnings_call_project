Person4,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"This is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person4,"We've looked at EB-5 but really haven't delved into it.
"
Person4,"There are some issues related to long-term job creation.
"
Person4,"We're primarily building condominiums.
"
Person4,"We've been able to access capital very easily given our scope, our size, and financial relationships.
"
Person4,"So EB-5 comes with some challenges, some timing issues, and other things so we've actually kind of stayed away from it.
"
Person4,"We have a lot of good joint venture partners that we deal with, very institutional quality.
"
Person4,"So if we were going to joint venture a deal, that's a more likely way we would go.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"38%.
"
Person1,"So 38% is a pretty normalized rate.
"
Person1,"The federal government wants 35% from us and the states want something in the neighborhood of 4.5% from us.
"
Person1,"So tax planning saves us a little bit.
"
Person1,"In 2015, our 32.4% number benefited from a settlement and reserve release with a particular state in the second quarter that was in the neighborhood of $14 million, and we also had a $5 million or $6 million state valuation allowance reversal in the fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"We do not expect either of those two items to recur next year.
"
Person1,"The assumption is that there are no impairments.
"
Person1,"You've restated it correctly.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So the impairment was a community in suburban Philadelphia that accounted for almost all of that impairment, north of $4 million of the $4.4 million.
"
Person1,"And the reserves for warranty and litigation are revisions of our estimated costs associated with the stucco disclosures we mentioned last year.
"
Person1,"I think that is a similar situation but the amount is not that much.
"
Person1,"If you were to ask me what the reserve was for, I would tell you it was additional water infiltration stucco repair costs.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Chad.
"
Person0,"Thanks, everyone.
"
Person0,"Have a wonderful holiday season, and we'll see you soon.
"
