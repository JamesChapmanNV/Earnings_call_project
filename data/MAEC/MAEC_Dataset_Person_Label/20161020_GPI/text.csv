Person1,"Yeah, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"That's a good question.
"
Person1,"There is dramatically increased supply on used vehicles.
"
Person1,"And that does put some pressure on the margins I think.
"
Person1,"But the good news is the used vehicle market appears to be quite strong.
"
Person1,"Even in the market like Oklahoma where new vehicle sales were down 18%, used were only down 2% or 3%.
"
Person1,"And in some months the markets' still somewhat flat on used.
"
Person1,"But yes, there's more supply which will give us more volume opportunity but it will probably have a little bit of margin trade-off.
"
Person0,"Jamie, this is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Our F&I performance in both Texas and Oklahoma still remains good.
"
Person0,"I think the, the biggest headwind that we would base on F&I is rise in interest rates.
"
Person0,"But so far as you can see we've produced and with the volume that we do in Texas and Oklahoma, F&I is held up.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"The PRU, said differently, PRU is held up, Jamie.
"
Person2,"It's just the volume impact that rolls through.
"
Person2,"Directionally, yes but there's some trade-off with the CPOs which come with the off lease vehicles.
"
Person1,"Yeah, to a certain degree.
"
Person1,"I don't think you can really leverage SG&A when you're down 10% or 18% because a certain percentage of your personnel costs are fixed.
"
Person1,"But yeah, we adjust the best we can on both personnel costs, advertising and you've seen the work we've done on inventory.
"
Person1,"We're pretty good at flexing the cost structure but it's not like you can really leverage when your sales are down that much.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK> <UNK>el.
"
Person2,"The volumes were down that much but as we indicated, we saw the same improvement in margins in those markets as we did overall.
"
Person2,"So, you know, the gross profit dollar were not pressured nearly as much as the volume headline would make you think.
"
Person2,"So that's why you're able to hold the profit decline to about that level.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"There's probably been an explosion in deals in recent months in both the US and the UK for obvious reasons.
"
Person1,"I don't have any indication that prices are more reasonable, but I think they will become more reasonable.
"
Person1,"Just because of supply and demand there.
"
Person1,"There are many people that understand that, the market growth isn't in the same profile potential as it was a few years back.
"
Person1,"That was just coincidental, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We are just always cleaning up.
"
Person1,"Sometimes you come up on a CapEx point where you have to invest in a facility and generally if the dealership is in a good return now, more CapEx isn't the answer to your problems.
"
Person1,"So those are mostly clean-up actions.
"
Person1,"I wouldn't read anything into that.
"
Person1,"We're still interested in expanding our company in all three of the markets if we can find opportunities that are return on investment hurdles.
"
Person2,"What we look at is rent adjusted total leverage and we're just around, kind of the high 3.8s close to 3.9.
"
Person2,"We really, from a protect the balance sheet standpoint don't want to go much above four times so there's a little bit of dry powder.
"
Person2,"If it was really the right deal, you might stretch for a short period.
"
Person2,"But in general we really kind of want to protect that four times cap.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, it's <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK> .
"
Person0,"We probably have as much communication and interaction with our lenders as we've had and I will tell you from our perspective we have not seen a pullback in credit whether it's the US or in Texas.
"
Person2,"Not really easily.
"
Person2,"Our sense is that, you know, overall used vehicle prices have been pretty solid.
"
Person2,"But I can't really give you an analytical cut of how much of is that is mix versus like-for-like.
"
Person2,"For our mix I would tell you that Mannheim is probably a little more accurate.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Thanks everyone for joining us today.
"
Person1,"We look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.
"
Person1,"Have a good day.
"
