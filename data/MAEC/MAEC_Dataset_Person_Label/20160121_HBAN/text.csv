Person0,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, there are two components in that line, right.
"
Person0,"There's the commercial, the treasury management revenue and then there's the retail side.
"
Person0,"Keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, we made our last fair play adjustment of $6 million.
"
Person0,"So you're seeing the first full quarter of kind of year-over-year growth off of the consumer side of the business reflecting the great job we do in bringing new households to the bank.
"
Person0,"And I'll also tell you that treasury management had a great year in terms of product capability, penetrating the customer base and fee growth.
"
Person0,"So certainly encouraged by what we see this quarter and definitely expect the trends to remain intact, especially relative to what you saw previous to this quarter.
"
Person1,"Well we continue to invest in the business.
"
Person1,"That's part of the plan.
"
Person1,"We've been investing every year.
"
Person1,"We pace that investment and taper it off.
"
Person1,"And then there are other categories of expenses that we would look to.
"
Person1,"And some of that would be some of the business expansion in terms of people and related.
"
Person1,"Certainly if we didn't see the revenue, the incentives and commissions would be adjusted.
"
Person1,"We may adjust some of our discretionary investments in a number of areas that we routinely want to look at.
"
Person1,"An example might be marketing.
"
Person1,"So hopefully that gives you -- there is a smorgasbord that we're working with.
"
Person1,"We do this routinely.
"
Person1,"It's part of what we deliver to our Board.
"
Person1,"If for some reason the economy starts changing, then we have a series of levels of contingent adjustments.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Hi, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"So we -- we're obviously always looking for acquisitions.
"
Person0,"I think we've been very consistent in how we talk about it.
"
Person0,"I would say for us, there's really no change in terms of activity.
"
Person0,"We look at core banking franchises.
"
Person0,"We look at opportunities like <UNK>quarie that we had this year and continue to look into six to eight footprint contiguous states.
"
Person0,"So I'd say, <UNK>, there's really no change in how we see the environment or how we approach the environment.
"
Person0,"It's probably too early to make that call.
"
Person0,"I would say it's been consistent in terms of what we see happening.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and certainly the full-year 2015 results.
"
Person1,"We delivered 13% annual growth in earnings per share and 4% annual growth in tangible book value per share.
"
Person1,"2015 results reflected a 12.4% return on tangible common equity and a one-on-one return on tangible -- return on assets.
"
Person1,"And as we enter 2016, I'm optimistic -- equally optimistic, I should say, with regard to the year ahead.
"
Person1,"Our strategies are working.
"
Person1,"Our investments continue to drive results.
"
Person1,"And our execution remains focused and strong.
"
Person1,"We are gaining market share and we are taking share of wallet.
"
Person1,"So we expect to generate annual revenue growth consistent with our long-term financial goals and we'll manage our continued investments in our businesses to the revenue environment.
"
Person1,"We continue to work toward becoming more efficient and improving returns.
"
Person1,"Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long-term shareholders.
"
Person1,"Our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent long-term performance.
"
Person1,"So I want to thank you for your interest in Huntington.
"
Person1,"We appreciate you joining us today.
"
Person1,"Have a great day.
"
