Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Let me speak to my thoughts only.
"
Person1,"And not put my opinion upon any producer out there.
"
Person1,"I think this industry is one that's hungry for margin.
"
Person1,"We certainly have seen some escalating gold price over a number of years that really didn't lead to margin expansion.
"
Person1,"We saw production expansion during that period of time.
"
Person1,"So, I think there will be a natural tendency for people to be looking for margin expansion.
"
Person1,"We're seeing some of the larger companies that are starting to right-size, would be my words, not theirs.
"
Person1,"Right-size their portfolio for sustainability.
"
Person1,"And all that makes good sense to me.
"
Person1,"The kind of projects that we're going to be interested in are going to be the higher quality projects.
"
Person1,"And I think there will still be opportunity for us in those areas.
"
Person1,"Today, I think the biggest opportunity for Royal Gold would be more on the base metal side.
"
Person1,"Where there's still balance sheets that are stressed.
"
Person1,"And that market hasn't come back as much as gold and silver have in the recent six months or so.
"
Person1,"So I think that's just a natural for us.
"
Person1,"That's the place where we can get assets that are very long-lived.
"
Person1,"It's a natural arbitrage between us and the base metal companies.
"
Person1,"They covet the base metal we covet the precious metal.
"
Person1,"That's really where I think the future of our business lies, at least in the near term.
"
Person1,"Having said that, Bill will not give up on opportunities that might be in the precious metal producer's space either.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, thank you for putting that question back to me because I don't want to miscommunicate here.
"
Person1,"We're very much looking for base metal mines with precious metal byproducts.
"
Person1,"And we really only desire the precious metals.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Sure, <UNK>, thanks for the question.
"
Person3,"Actually, for the last three quarters or so we've just been booking the Voisey Bay royalty on a cash basis.
"
Person3,"So we are not booking any revenue or expected revenue on an accrual basis for Voisey's Bay.
"
Person3,"We're just booking cash when it's received.
"
Person3,"That's been the case for all of this fiscal year.
"
Person3,"Until we got better clarity or we started receiving payments, we will not have any revenue or accrued revenue for Voisey's Bay.
"
Person3,"That's correct.
"
Person3,"We really wouldn't have any accounting until he we received some cash or the litigation was settled in some way.
"
Person1,"Well, I was going to ask <UNK> to answer that question until you broadened it right there.
"
Person1,"I'm just kind of searching through my mind.
"
Person1,"Our portfolio's running very, very well right now.
"
Person1,"So not anything that we would have had concerns on.
"
Person1,"We would have guided the market to that would be material.
"
Person1,"So nothing on that standpoint.
"
Person1,"You know that the management team's focused on the Voisey's Bay litigation and has been.
"
Person1,"We're not taking our eye off the ball but Bruce is working on that.
"
Person1,"And with regard to Rainy River's construction there, we're very much focused on a quality project over the long term.
"
Person1,"And we have encouraged, and we didn't really need to emphasize this to New Gold, because they know how to do things right.
"
Person1,"We want to make sure that they take the time and get the skills and resources they need to build a quality project for the next decade and a half or two decades.
"
Person1,"We're quite comfortable with how that's coming together, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thanks very much.
"
Person1,"Thanks, operator.
"
Person1,"And thank you for joining the call today.
"
Person1,"We surely appreciate your interest and continued support of Royal Gold.
"
Person1,"And we'll look forward to updating you on our next quarterly conference call.
"
Person1,"Thanks everyone.
"
