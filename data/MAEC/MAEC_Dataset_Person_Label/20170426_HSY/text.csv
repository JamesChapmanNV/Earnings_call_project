Person1,"$55 million.
"
Person0,"Thanks for the question.
"
Person0,"Yes, we continue to feel really good with the programs that we have on the core brands.
"
Person0,"And so I think in terms of continuing the growth on something like Reese, it is continuing the news, and some of our incremental investments in advertising towards the back part of the year will be made against those core brands to continue to leverage the momentum.
"
Person0,"And then at the same time, we are absolutely focused on turning around and accelerating our growth trajectory on some of the other pieces of portfolio, namely on the non-chocolate sweets area.
"
Person0,"So we will be increasing our investment there, although at the same time, we've right-sized those brands a bit.
"
Person0,"So as <UNK> mentioned, SKU rationalization, there are some areas where we had extended those brands and we had items in the marketplace that just weren't productive or profitable and so we made the decision to take the hit on pulling back on some of that.
"
Person0,"But we do have teams very focused on accelerating the growth there, and I think that's an opportunity for us going forward.
"
Person0,"No, I don't really think it's not as well positioned.
"
Person0,"I would say I think that we have opportunities to just fix our execution on that piece of the portfolio.
"
Person0,"There was a little bit more competition from smaller players last year where they went really aggressively on price, some of the things that we weren't willing to do given our focus on margin.
"
Person0,"So I really think it's more about what we do versus that there's any kind of consumer trend issue there.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"So let me start and then I'll transfer it over to <UNK>.
"
Person0,"There is almost no -- there is no shipment impact from that timing of Easter.
"
Person0,"I mean, we shipped almost nothing in terms of Easter into the second quarter.
"
Person0,"So that's not an issue at all.
"
Person0,"And relative to the write-offs, we feel great about Malaysia.
"
Person0,"So the write-offs that we've talked about are not at all related to Malaysia.
"
Person1,"And in terms of the cost base, that came online April 1 of last year.
"
Person1,"So that impact will be getting smaller going forward or really going away in terms of fixed cost absorption.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"It's all in the base now.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We still feel good that we're in positive territory.
"
Person1,"Yes, the quarters always come in a little bit different depending on promotion and innovation calendar.
"
Person1,"But there's nothing that would be falling off that kind of a cliff in the second quarter.
"
Person0,"So as part of our margins for growth and margin expansion program, we've started immediately in terms of taking the necessary steps to reset our investment in that marketplace and make some of the tough decisions.
"
Person0,"At the same time, the local teams have built very focused plans in terms of where we are focusing to grow and build a sustainable business model.
"
Person0,"So we are focused on a multiyear program but beginning now to really focus on a couple of key provinces on our core portfolio and on profitable mix of brands across the portfolio.
"
Person0,"As you all know, the cost structure in some of the channels in China have changed and so we are shifting to more profitable channels and really try to capture some of the growth, both in the second- and third-tier cities as well as e-commerce.
"
Person0,"So it's a multiyear program that's under way now, and I'd say we can continue to update you as the year goes on.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I mean, I think for competitive purposes, we\u2019d prefer not to go into all of the details.
"
Person0,"But we can give some thought to what we can share that might help you as you're building your models.
"
Person0,"We see -- we've done very well with online e-commerce in China.
"
Person0,"As it's a big piece of marketplace, it's been a nice growth driver for our business.
"
Person0,"We\u2019ve continued to see nice growth there and it is clearly, amongst the channels, probably our #1 area of focus from a channel perspective in that marketplace.
"
Person0,"So we have -- we've built some infrastructure and that will continue to be a place that we'll want to invest in China going forward as in the U.S.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
