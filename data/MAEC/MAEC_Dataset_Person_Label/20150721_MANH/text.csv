Person1,"Very good.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"By the way, this quarter's operating cash flow is the second best quarter in the history of Manhattan Associates.
"
Person1,"We can, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I think it's a little bit of both, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"There's no -- as you know, there's no silver bullet here to bringing license revenue in for the quarter.
"
Person1,"We still are subject to a little bit of lumpiness.
"
Person1,"We are still subject to big deal timing.
"
Person1,"But I do think our close rates are solid.
"
Person1,"We are seeing good momentum, particularly in retail and omni-channel initiatives.
"
Person1,"And frankly, hats off to our sales team who are executing very well across the globe.
"
Person0,"We never discount that, but the lean would be really more towards investing in growing our intellectual capital headcount, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Let's see.
"
Person1,"A couple three questions in there, <UNK>, and all good ones.
"
Person1,"By the way it was Lilly Pulitzer that presented at Momentum.
"
Person1,"No problem.
"
Person1,"Just wanted to make sure that we were clear there.
"
Person1,"And I wasn't talking about another particular signature win during the prepared remarks.
"
Person1,"But with regard to the momentum and the focus around retail store solutions and so forth, we're certainly seeing a lot of interest.
"
Person1,"Your question was, should we expect to see that business developing faster than our order lifecycle management business.
"
Person1,"It looks a little bit like order lifecycle management of a few years ago.
"
Person1,"There's a great deal of interest out in the marketplace.
"
Person1,"The buying cycles are still very long, at the moment.
"
Person1,"You're seeing early adopters get on board.
"
Person1,"And I think it'll be 18, 24 months, in my view, before we start seeing consistent buying cycles in that space, much like the ones we are now seeing in the order lifecycle management space.
"
Person1,"Yes, sure.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Appreciate it.
"
Person1,"Okay, Kyle.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you very much, everybody, for joining us this afternoon.
"
Person1,"I appreciate your time.
"
Person1,"And we will certainly look forward to updating you on our Q3 results in about 90 days or so.
"
Person1,"Good afternoon.
"
