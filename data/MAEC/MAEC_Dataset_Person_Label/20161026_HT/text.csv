Person0,"We are always looking at opportunities really all across the country.
"
Person0,"And we do spend a lot of time on some of the other higher-growth MSAs in the country, like we've looked at a lot of opportunities in Seattle, for example, or a handful of other markets around the country.
"
Person0,"But to date, we're finding enough runway in our core six markets.
"
Person0,"And in those core six markets, we have significant portfolios already, which give us unique market insight, give us truly more operating leverage to bring to bear on these assets, and so real advantage on the buy side as well as on the execution site.

Person0,"But to date, we've found enough strong opportunities for the amount that we're acquiring, which is really -- it sounds like a lot, but there are a handful of assets in markets we know very, very well.
"
Person0,"And we're comfortable with that approach for now.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"No more closing remarks.
"
Person0,"But we well -- <UNK>, Ash and I will all be here in the office the rest of the day and look forward to any further follow-ups.
"
Person0,"Thank you all for your time.
