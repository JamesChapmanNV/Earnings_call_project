Person0,"Our next question from <UNK> <UNK> with Oppenheimer.
"
Person2,"It's relatively flat.
"
Person2,"It might be down just a tiny, tiny amount in Q4 possibly, but the reality is that it won't even be a material change and so as we see the balance of the year laying out, just Q2, Q3,Q4 are essentially flat revenue.
"
Person1,"And I appreciate the concern that a number of you are signalling around the second half volume basis, and what we've said all along is that in the event that the volume [cases are any] different than what we anticipate, that we'll be more aggressive around the things that we will do around managing costs and so as you can imagine, we have a contingency plan that we're working through as a Leadership Team around what happens, if, in fact, we end up with a volume issue in the second half of the year (technical difficulties).

Person1,"No, I'd say Lighting, I mean every year, it's a business given that the input costs and the price of LEDs has continued to fall.
"
Person1,"Every year it's a business that basically sheds a bit of price, but also the input costs and the costs of that LED technology continues to drop, so I'd say in that business overall, ordinary [force] is that it's a competitive business and the technology costs continue to decline and our margins in that business, quite frankly, are performing just fine.
"
Person1,"And we had another quarter of strong margins in Q2.
"
Person1,"We think that business is fine and very much consistent with the guidance that we've laid out for products during the course of the year.
"
Person0,"Thank you all for joining us today.

Person0,"We're at the top of the hour to [wrapping] and would like to wrap up our call.
