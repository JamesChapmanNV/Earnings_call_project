Person1,"On the remodel/rep<UNK>ce side, we began seeing that recovery in 2011.
"
Person1,"That continues to date and we are not back to normal behavior yet, but we are certainly on our way there.
"
Person1,"In terms of new pool construction, that is <UNK>gging and I think that we are beginning to see a term that was used in the financial community about five years ago, four or five years ago, green shoots.
"
Person1,"So we are beginning to see green shoots both on the psychology of homeowners to invest in their homes.
"
Person1,"Obviously that took a hard hit back in 2008-2009, so that is beginning to happen now in the form of home improvements.
"
Person1,"And, second, we are beginning to see several financial institutions going back in and providing lending based on home equity, whether that's redoing a first or second or a home equity loan.
"
Person1,"We are beginning to see that.
"
Person1,"So I am not expecting a big pickup there in 2015, but I expect that as we move through the ba<UNK>nce of this decade we're going to get progressively more traction there.
"
Person1,"Sure, two things.
"
Person1,"Texas did not have a particu<UNK>rly strong first quarter, but when you look underneath that it wasn't so much because of energy or the economic environment in Texas.
"
Person1,"It was driven primarily because the weather was not particu<UNK>rly good in Texas.
"
Person1,"And when you look at the activity that we are seeing in April, we are seeing more normalized levels of activity.
"
Person1,"So net-net is -- we haven't seen any headwinds, noteworthy headwinds because of energy.
"
Person1,"Again, most of the business that we do, whether it's Texas or anywhere else, is basic pool maintenance and repair and then associated remodeling and rep<UNK>cement activities on existing pools.
"
Person1,"So that, other than weather moving it up a month or two or back a month or two in the year-round markets, is not a big deal in terms of having any macro impact.
"
Person1,"And new pool construction, I looked at the permits through the end of March <UNK>st week and in all of the markets in Texas -- Dal<UNK>s, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin -- where I looked at permit information on a monthly basis, in all those cases it was either f<UNK>t or better than <UNK>st year.
"
Person1,"Consistent with the guidance in terms of what I just spoke about a minute ago and in terms of the second quarter and then going on through -- well, second-quarter guidance that I gave earlier.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Maureen, and thank you all for joining us on the call.
"
Person1,"We are now totally engaged in the biggest sales and profit quarter of the year with our sales increasing almost every day.
"
Person1,"Our team is making it happen and we look forward to reporting our results to you on our next earnings call on Thursday, July 23.
"
Person1,"Have a great day.
