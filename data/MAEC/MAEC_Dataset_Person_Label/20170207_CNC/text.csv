Person1,"Well, I think -- we are on record as saying that margin expansion is still a short and longer-term objective of ours.
"
Person1,"And the higher acuity populations, as we said, we had the systems and capability and I think that we're -- the more of that we have, we can enhance it.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, you want to add anything.
"
Person2,"Yes, we've always held this long-term pretax margin of between 3% and 5%.
"
Person2,"And I think, obviously, there's a lot of opportunity on margin.
"
Person2,"We talk about synergies and the run rate synergies and executing on those.
"
Person2,"I think we still have room to go as far as systems and the operational systems that <UNK> mentioned before.
"
Person2,"Additionally, there's always investment income.
"
Person2,"Right now interest rates are relatively low.
"
Person2,"So there's a lot of things I think out there for the opportunity to expand margins in the future.
"
Person1,"I think our mindset is -- our population is 400% of the total poverty level and below.
"
Person1,"We're very focused -- we're not trying to grow beyond that except in California where we have the large group business and they have had historically the relationships to support that.
"
Person1,"But if any of the providers that fit within our traditional provider group want to join, we'll be happy to talk to them.
"
Person1,"But we find that the network we have is very adequate for the population we're attracting and serving.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, you want to take the population --.
"
Person3,"Yes, <UNK>, just in terms of the markets where we've had stronger presence on the marketplace in 2017.
"
Person3,"So not surprisingly, that matches up with where we have just a stronger presence generally at the local level.
"
Person3,"So states like Texas -- in addition to the California and Arizona markets, so Texas, Florida, Georgia, those are all markets where we have a meaningful marketplace in 2017.
"
Person2,"Yes, and this is <UNK>, I'll answer your second question.
"
Person2,"It doesn't change our views because ultimately the minimum MLR ended in June 30 and they were accruing to that level.
"
Person2,"And July 1 there was a rate reduction in the Medicaid expansion rates -- a sizable rate reduction, really in combination with eliminating the minimum MLR.
"
Person2,"So it doesn't change our views on the profitability of that product going forward.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Close.
"
Person1,"Close, yes, more or less.
"
Person2,"Yes, I think we talked about that at our December Investor Day.
"
Person2,"So, yes, it was -- we mentioned that.
"

Person2,"Predominantly.
"
Person2,"Last year was a moderate level of flu, so there's a lot of puts and takes.

"
Person1,"<UNK>.
"
Person3,"Yes, not sure we'd comment a lot on that just -- other than to say that the preliminary view is it's in line with expectations.
"
Person3,"Our analysis is pretty consistent with a lot of the reports that we've seen that have come out over the course of the last week.
"
Person3,"So there's some variability from state to state, so we're not in a position to get into that just yet.
"
Person3,"But I think it's a good starting point is how I would characterize it.
"
Person1,"(Multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"I've been upper early rehearsing for you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Can you tell me what Trump said last night.
"
Person1,"Yes, we've been talking about the bands or he's hearing us, so -- and any of these things he does that improves it, there's going to be a lot of discussion about it, so it's all good.

"
Person1,"They understand it.
"
Person1,"They understand how big we are in this business so it carries some weight.
"
Person1,"They are soliciting some of our opinions.
"
Person1,"We have a very active Washington office, so any of these things that expand -- that correct some of the things that need a corrected will only help us.
"
Person1,"Well, I want to thank you all for participating and I will tell you, I look forward to being able to have more of these kinds of calls with the kind of results we delivered this past quarter.
