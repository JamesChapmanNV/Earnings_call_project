Person,Sentence
Person1,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"It's hard to split because the customers can use the reactor in a variety of different ways.
"
Person1,"So it's hard for us to have visibility of exactly where they're going to use it.
"
Person1,"Clearly the lighting market is growing.
"
Person1,"We said fine-pitch market is growing by 25%.
"
Person1,"And then with the TV uptick, which a year ago, basically as the TV market fell off, then that was making reactors available to use for lighting.
"
Person1,"But now it's actually requiring more.
"
Person1,"So I can't really give you a breakdown of how it goes, but I think all three sections are needing more reactors.
"
Person1,"So that's the good thing.
"
Person1,"Nobody's freeing anything up.
"
Person1,"Most of the orders that we've been getting have been for new capacity.
"
Person1,"We did see some replacement orders over the last year.
"
Person1,"There are about I think 2,300 reactors in the installed base.
"
Person1,"A lot of those, probably two-thirds of those were shipped in the 2009, 2010 and 2011 really ramp-up.
"
Person1,"They are getting old and they are less productive.
"
Person1,"We're not seeing a large replacement market yet, but we believe that it will come in the coming years and it will be a significant opportunity for us.
"
Person1,"Yes, 2018, 2019, hard to read exactly, but -- and different customers will probably approach it a little differently.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we may not be able to provide you a numerical figure like that.
"
Person2,"But yes, I think we can say that the industry is consolidated, so the order pattern and the sales pattern would be concentrated among the top five, six customers, yes.
"
Person2,"That we can say.
"
Person2,"But it's hard to give you a figure around that.
"
Person1,"It might be a little bigger than five.
"
Person1,"I'd say five to eight or so.
"
Person1,"But yes.
"
Person1,"Go ahead.
"
Person1,"I can't say.
"
Person1,"They've had a history of recent years of making their own, but I think they've also had a history in recent years of buying their mid-power laser diodes from other sources.
"
Person1,"So don't really know there.
"
Person2,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"They're actually not inspection systems.
"
Person1,"They're Ion Beam Deposition systems to build the mass blanks which are then processed further.
"
Person1,"We received an order for one of these.
"
Person1,"These tend to be long lead times of nine months or more.
"
Person1,"We're not counting on any more orders this year and it's really going to depend on the progress in the industry as far as EUV adoption.
"
Person1,"But they're probably our longest lead-time product.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"So for the full year, we are committed to 40% or higher for gross margin at the Company level.
"
Person2,"We did about 41% in 2016 and then feel very good about 40% plus in 2017.
"
Person2,"In terms of temporary impact to gross margin, we have a little bit of duplicate expenses going on in Q4.
"
Person2,"And also about 1% or so getting impacted in Q1.
"
Person2,"So gross margin should begin to improve from Q2 once the consolidation initiative is behind us.
"
Person2,"As you know, gross margins always can get impacted depending on product mix, regional mix or the shipment volume levels.
"
Person2,"But at this point based on the visibility that we have, we feel pretty good about having 40% or higher for the entire year.
"
Person2,"For a given quarter here or there it may rotate around that number, plus, minus 1% or so.
"
Person2,"But overall for the full year we feel pretty good about starting it with a four [handle].
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"At this point we will conclude the call.
"
Person1,"Thank you for joining us.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
