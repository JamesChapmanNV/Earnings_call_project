Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"I'll let <UNK> dig out the China revenue question.
"
Person0,"In terms of the marketplace, I think everybody in the industry is looking at results and input over the last few weeks.
"
Person0,"And there's clearly a lot of churn around well how strong is the China market going to be, as we go through the second half of calendar 2015.
"
Person0,"And we're kind of in that same mode as well.
"
Person0,"In some ways it's good news where last year Q2 was so strong, there was a bit of inventory build-up.
"
Person0,"We don't see that affect this year, and so we think we're seeing good, natural sell-through in the marketplace.
"
Person0,"And, overall, I would say we see a pretty solid market, but we're playing it conservative at this juncture and expecting fairly modest growth rates in the China market
"
Person1,"Yeah.
"
Person1,"Just at a percentage level of our overall mobile revenue, in Q4 we were in the upper teens from a revenue percentage standpoint for China mobile products.
"
Person1,"And actually moving into Q1 we expect similar levels of mix from China mobile.
"
Person0,"For those that have followed us, you know, that's an uptick.
"
Person0,"We kind of said low to mid-teens for the past few quarters so, as I said, we're seeing a nice overall bump there as we see our display integrated products take a more prominent role with the China OEMs.
"
Person0,"So haptics is linked with Force, and I think any implementation you see on Force, will for the most part we'll have some sort of haptic response.
"
Person0,"That can range from a variety of things, from just auditory to the actual -- the physical vibration that you get in some solutions.
"
Person0,"So we'll see a range of haptic implementation going forward.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Well, again, thank you, everyone.
"
Person0,"We had a good robust set of questions there.
"
Person0,"Appreciate it everyone getting in on the call today, and we look forward to talking to you in a few months.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
