Person0,"Well, clearly the new chair of the FCC spoke this morning in Spain, and highlighted why facilities-based competition is what he believes is the best way to facilitate the appointment of high-bandwidth technology.
"
Person0,"It's always nice to hear a clear articulation of a facilities-based competition.
"
Person0,"I think with respect to convergence, that is something we've been living with, had it through numerous different regulatory regimes in different administrations.
"
Person0,"Because I think it's the way that technology and consumer preference are pushing our customers.
"
Person0,"So I don't have a specific view on any combinations.
"
Person0,"But just know that, as our customers have all gotten bigger, their spending has become more durable, it's longer lasting and of greater magnitude.
"
Person0,"And that's over the last 25 years I've been doing this.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, with respect to tax policy, who knows.
"
Person0,"There's a number of proposals that are out there.
"
Person0,"I guess the good thing is, what they all have in common is a lower federal tax rate.
"
Person0,"And we're basically a full-basis taxpayer, with very small International revenue -- and don't really get any tax preferences, so we have nothing to give up.
"
Person0,"So any lower rate will be helpful.
"
Person0,"If you go beyond that and you talk about the expensing of capital expenditures, that's obviously helpful in a business where we're growing as rapidly as we are.
"
Person0,"The flip side is what they do around the tax deductibility of interest.
"
Person0,"It's a little bit hard to say.
"
Person0,"What I would put out there is that we still find the debt markets attractive.
"
Person0,"We have a new source of capital that we wanted to get into the facility.
"
Person0,"We freed up revolver capacity.
"
Person0,"And we have -- as we said, we've grown $500 million in the trailing 12 months, and we've got opportunities going forward to use capital.
"
Person0,"So that's why we put it in place.
"
Person0,"So we didn't have any legal expenses that were material to our numbers in the quarter, and don't expect to have any going forward.
"
Person0,"All right.
"
Person0,"Just before we go, <UNK> is going to round out our disclosure on our top-10 customers.
"
Person0,"So go ahead, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Customer number six was at 5% of revenue -- and this was for a customer who has requested that we not disclose their identity.
"
Person1,"Charter Communications was number seven at 3.6% of revenue.
"
Person1,"Crown Capital was number eight at 1.6% of revenue.
"
Person1,"Frontier Communications was number nine at 1.6% of revenue.
"
Person1,"And Questar Gas was number 10 at 0.5% of revenue.
"
Person0,"And the split also.
"
Person1,"And the split -- telco was at 68.1%, cable was at 24.4%, facility locating was at 4.9%, and electrical and other was at 2.6%.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Well, we thank everybody for your time and attention, and we will talk you on our third-quarter call in May.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
