Person,Sentence
Person2,"I gave a range, a range based on everything you see, as to about where we think you should be looking.
"
Person2,"In that range.
"
Person2,"Again, as we keep telling you, there's 1 million moving parts.
"
Person2,"And so for me to get any -- even think about anything more precise than that -- or even you guys.
"
Person2,"I don't understand how you guys are coming up with a number that you could be comfortable with.
"
Person2,"There's a lot of things that will be changing during the course of the year -- just the debt instruments that are going to be coming off, and new coming on, and loan production coming on, loans being sold -- so there's a lot.
"
Person2,"I gave you a number or some range that I thought might make sense.
"
Person1,"Well, we think -- I won't answer that question.
"
Person1,"I'm on the Board of the Fed.
"
Person1,"People will misread it! I'm not that I know!
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"We have built in some incremental increase in the prime rate during the course of the year, but not a lot.
"
Person2,"We are not looking at the same thing that we think we are hearing from the Fed at this point.
"
Person2,"I'll speak on it.
"
Person2,"Gerry never told me anything.
"
Person1,"I don't --.
"
Person2,"He doesn't know!
"
Person1,"I don't know! (laughter)
"
Person2,"Yes, it's actually been performing pretty well.
"
Person2,"One of the things that we did is that we capped the valuation of those loans way back when.
"
Person2,"So even as loans went up to $1 million -- not loans, the valuations went up from (multiple speakers) $1.25 million, we did not do that.
"
Person2,"And so we capped it out at about $800,000.
"
Person2,"And they are performing at this point.
"
Person2,"We only have one loan in the entire portfolio that exceeds 80%, and half of them are amortizing loans.
"
Person2,"But there's a lot of loans that are way less than that.
"
Person2,"There's about 30% of the loans that are less than 50% LTV.
"
Person2,"That one loan -- I'm sorry, the $800,000 --.
"
Person1,"Let me explain it.
"
Person1,"$800,000 is what we put the value cap at.
"
Person1,"And then we only lent a percentage against that.
"
Person1,"It's not that we went $800,000; we were lending in most cases two-thirds of that or less.
"
Person1,"There may be a couple exceptions to that two-thirds, but most of them were under the two-thirds.
"
Person1,"So we had a pretty good valuation cushion on it.
"
Person1,"And right now, as I know, they are all performing.
"
Person2,"As far as I know.
"
Person1,"They are all performing.
"
Person2,"They're all performing.
"
Person2,"We have zero delinquents.
"
Person1,"I'm hearing from my credit people -- zero nonperforming.
"
Person1,"And most -- almost all of them are amortizing loans, also.
"
Person1,"They are not all a static loan.
"
Person2,"So far not.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"Good point.
"
Person1,"We are always on the outlook to grow our franchise through acquisitions.
"
Person1,"Our primary focus has been in the Florida marketplace, because you really have to focus your attention one place at a time.
"
Person1,"And right now we are trying to build our Florida franchise.
"
Person1,"So we are looking for additional opportunities in Florida.
"
Person1,"That being said, while our primary focus is not in the legacy New York/New Jersey area, if the right opportunity came along, we would be happy to consider that.
"
Person1,"I don't know how the regulators think, but I know how we think.
"
Person1,"I personally have my views about cap rates.
"
Person1,"When I see banks lending, I don't care what kind of property it is, using a sub-3 cap rate, I think it's ridiculous.
"
Person1,"So pretty much we have, like we did with the taxi medallion loans -- we appraise not using necessarily the cap rate that the appraiser might come up with; we have our own floors that we like to impose on our loans, which very often changes the valuation considerably.
"
Person1,"But we are comfortable, and that's how we've always lent money at the Bank.
"
Person1,"We did not get involved in the subprime residential mortgage market for the same reasons.
"
Person1,"Just because everybody thinks it's a great place to be doesn't necessarily mean we agree with that.
"
Person1,"We adjust our cap rates -- I think when you hear some of the cap rates that are bandied around, I think it's just ridiculous.
"
Person1,"It's interesting that the Florida marketplace seems to use even a higher cap rate than we see up here.
"
Person1,"So it gives me a little bit more comfort on the valuations I see coming out of Florida.
"
Person0,"Thank you for joining us on our fourth-quarter conference call.
"
Person0,"Have a good day.
