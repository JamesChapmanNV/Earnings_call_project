Person,Sentence
Person0,"Okay, <UNK>, thanks.
"
Person0,"Operator, next question, please.
"
Person1,"Okay, we're not going to get specific about BAMTech.
"
Person1,"We said it's going to be dilutive but very -- in a very modest way.
"
Person1,"And it's obviously not been a public company.
"
Person1,"But we're not going to -- we're just not going to get specific about that.
"
Person1,"I can tell you a fair amount about Shanghai, although not going to give you too many numbers.
"
Person1,"We expected an opening that a large part of the visitation would come from Shanghai.
"
Person1,"And actually we have been surprised that the visitation from the rest of China has been as strong as it has been.
"
Person1,"Because our concentration from a marketing perspective was largely in the local region, but it's come from all over China.
"
Person1,"One factor could be that Shanghai is a tourist destination for the rest of China, particularly in the summer, and that people from Shanghai are waiting for the tourist season to end before they visit.
"
Person1,"Now, a visitation from Shanghai has also been strong.
"
Person1,"We did some research and there was 98% awareness of the park among the people in Shanghai and well over 70% intent to visit from the people in Shanghai.
"
Person1,"So that's really -- those are incredible statistics.
"
Person1,"I mentioned earlier on the call that people who are coming are staying almost two hours longer than we expected.
"
Person1,"That's a very good thing because it suggests that they are really enjoying the product.
"
Person1,"And that, in fact, is the case because we've done a fair amount of research on guest reaction, guest satisfaction, and it's very high.
"
Person1,"We won't get very specific with you about per caps except the per caps have been quite strong, particularly in the food and beverage side.
"
Person1,"And we're also doing very well with our hotels -- 95%, 96% occupancy.
"
Person1,"And Lion King, which is a separate ticket, is also doing extremely well and very well-booked.
"
Person1,"So we had essentially a flawless opening that the people not just of Shanghai, but the people of China have embraced.
"
Person1,"Clearly, the marketing has worked, and the product is performing really well.
"
Person1,"And with that in mind, we are already expanding.
"
Person1,"We broke ground a while ago on expansion of the park.
"
Person1,"We have not announced exactly what it is that we are building, but we are already building to expand.
"
Person1,"And we have plenty of property, I should remind everyone.
"
Person1,"So we have an opportunity to build out new lands, new gate, new hotels, new restaurants, et cetera.
"
Person1,"All very positive.
"
Person0,"All right.
"
Person0,"Thanks for the question.
"
Person0,"Operator, we have time for one more question, please.
"
Person1,"That new Sling product is pretty skinny.
"
Person1,"I was going to say it is so skinny you can't you can see it.
"
Person1,"But I mentioned earlier on the call that a few new products have entered the marketplace without us, namely without ESPN.
"
Person1,"Sony was one and had real troubles getting off the ground.
"
Person1,"And in Sony's case, when ESPN was added, they had a significant uptick in their subs.
"
Person1,"So I don't want to suggest that Sling has to have ESPN.
"
Person1,"They will determine that.
"
Person1,"But as we look at the product that they are offering, we really don't believe that it is going to have -- it has a great future because it's lacking some of the most attractive channels that are out there.
"
Person1,"You can slice and dice some of these channels, but -- to create packages, but if you don't have some of the best ones, it's pretty hard to see significant adoption of the services being offered.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"On parks CapEx, you are right in that the number was down for the quarter, but I wouldn't read too much into that.
"
Person2,"A lot of that is timing related.
"
Person2,"As we have mentioned before and <UNK> mentioned, the offerings that will be -- that are underway and soon to come to the theme park near you such as the Star Wars lands in both Anaheim and Orlando, those are underway.
"
Person2,"So this CapEx is more of a timing issue, and we will update next quarter for the prospective year on what to look forward to for fiscal 2017.
"
Person1,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I just want to thank everybody for the call, and hope you all have a good rest of your summer.
"
Person1,"We feel really good about this quarter.
"
Person1,"Clearly, the bottom-line 12% increase in EPS was quite strong.
"
Person1,"The studio's performance, as <UNK> mentioned, through three quarters is record performance for us already, maybe record performance for any studio in the industry.
"
Person1,"And the slate going forward is extremely strong.
"
Person1,"What we did in Shanghai was certainly something that we feel great about and very excited about, and the future there is very bright.
"
Person1,"And the two announcements that we made today are really important.
"
Person1,"BAMTech provides us with a great opportunity in a space that is very exciting both to us and to consumers.
"
Person1,"And the OTT relationship that we have now created with AT&T Direct is also very important.
"
Person1,"We think they're going to launch an incredibly robust platform with a great user interface, and it's great to be part of that launch.
"
Person1,"Thank you all very much.
"
Person0,"Okay, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"I guess I now get to read the Safe Harbor.
"
Person0,"Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

Person0,"Note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were discussed on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our investor relations website.
