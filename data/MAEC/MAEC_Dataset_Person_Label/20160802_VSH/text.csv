Person2,"I do not believe that this has anything to do with the move of the production itself; it goes very smoothly.
"
Person2,"It is over, at least we supply from the new plant seamless, it is really quite -- there is no interruption for the customer, the customer has not suffered whatsoever.
"
Person2,"It was done properly.
"
Person2,"At the moment we do suffer from the weakness in computers there is no question because this is a traditional place.
"
Person2,"And we work on growing our automotive of part of the business.
"
Person2,"But I do admit that this by far, the others look very good, the other lines that this is [still just] performance.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we compare naturally knowing the history that not only we have in the last years but of course we compare the performance vis-a-vis prior years.
"
Person2,"And the picture this year is definitely better than the prior years so we are confident to meet the projection in the third quarter.
"
Person2,"As I said the strategy hasn't changed a bit.
"
Person2,"We're looking for reasonable acquisitions and continue to do so.
"
Person2,"But on the other hand they must be available so we are looking.
"
Person2,"We are looking across the board that means in all of our product lines and in all geographies.
"
Person2,"But it has to make sense and of course we have always a few candidates that are evaluated.
"
Person2,"But it is really too early to talk about these opportunities which may come.
"
Person2,"I think we all were right in anticipating a further decline.
"
Person2,"The decline has slowed down.
"
Person2,"There's no question about it, but still it declines.
"
Person2,"Not in a substantial form as it has been since quite some years but to see a recovery maybe for instance.
"
Person2,"I would not say that at all.
"
Person2,"Seasonally it has been stronger in the second quarter than before, but the real recovery is something else.
"
Person2,"Maybe it has bottomed out, but who knows.
"
Person2,"Many projections were too early in that sense it was quite a few years that expected to be bottoming out, and then it didn't happen.
"
Person2,"One thing is for sure that the decline became less steep, there is no question.
"
Person2,"No, not really to us.
"
Person2,"We are just observers.
"
Person2,"We do feel it not only us, we do feel that our customers have substantial price [hikes] at the moment which is just a plain statement I think.
"
Person2,"You are talking distribution and POS [divided] by POA, right.
"
Person2,"Approximately 1.02.
"
Person2,"POS was up by 2.5%.
"
Person2,"And the orders on our distributors were up by 3%.
"
Person2,"Slight, very slight.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>a.
"
Person0,"Thank you for your interest in Vishay Intertechnology.
"
Person0,"I will turn the call back to you, <UNK>a.
