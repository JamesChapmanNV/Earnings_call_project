Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"When we talked about the $300 million of incremental revenue synergies, we said that that would typically be in a three- to five-year type of time period.
"
Person1,"And so we'll have to continue to monitor that, but that's our initial assumption going in.
"
Person1,"In addition to the residential mortgage, one of the big areas for us is our cash management services, Treasury management services for the commercial side.
"
Person1,"And as we take a look at the activity levels that we're seeing right now, we're seeing a nice increase as far as potential referrals and pipeline associated with that.
"
Person1,"I think we've got over 200 First Niagara customers that are at least talking to us about adding additional Treasury management services, and so that would be another category that we also have potential growth and a number of other products and services, some of which came from First Niagara and some of which are for legacy Key.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, anything else you'd want to add there.
"
Person0,"In the product capabilities, again, a robust offering for the commercial customers would also include what we put in our corporate services income of FX and derivatives and a broad suite there.
"
Person0,"We also look at wealth management and private banking, and within that, we have investment management and other services that I think will be a good fit, again for their consumer, as well as business customers within Key.
"
Person1,"Really again, I think it falls back to we think it's a three- to five-year time period, so you can think about that ramping up over that time period.
"
Person1,"So I would say that we'll provide a little bit more guidance as we get into the fourth quarter call in January and provide more clarity as far as the timing and the level of recognition associated with those revenue synergies.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today.
"
Person0,"If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221.
"
Person0,"And with that, that concludes our remarks and our conference.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much and have a great day.
"
