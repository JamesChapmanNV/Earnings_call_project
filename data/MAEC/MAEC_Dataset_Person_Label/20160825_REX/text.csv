Person1,"No, no, exactly.
"
Person1,"This is much better than what USDA was showing.
"
Person1,"That's correct.
"
Person1,"Yes, that's what we estimate, $3 million to $5 million.
"
Person1,"That's the remainder of the year.
"
Person0,"Yes, a little bit finish up and then maintenance, correct.
"
Person1,"Actually, we have applied it also for One Earth Energy pathway, pathway we have not received, and we are applying for EPA to -- we already had up to 125 million gallons we produce at One Earth Energy, but we are trying to increase it at the slow step there due to some regulation in Illinois.
"
Person1,"We probably increased to 135 million and then further to increase that later on close to 150 million.
"
Person1,"But all of these things really we have to wait for up the time we receive the pathway for One Earth Energy to increase further production.
"
Person1,"Correct.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think we will -- that is our ultimate goal we'd like to achieve.
"
Person1,"I think it's hard to say that, because we are trying to make sure that, when we are pushing these extra gallons, we want to make sure that we go slow and making sure the other bottlenecks are worked out so that we don't have any emergency or create some problem.
"
Person1,"So, I think it depends, but I think we are, at the NuGen, we are very close to that level but we are going very slow.
"
Person1,"So it's really hard to say, but I think early next year is expected.
"
Person1,"You mean to 150 million or 135 million.
"
Person1,"I think we have mostly capital investment is already done, and maybe it grows $3 million to $5 million more, as I said.
"
Person1,"But we are not pushing hard at One Earth Energy due to the reason we do not have a pathway.
"
Person1,"Up to the time we receive the pathway, then we will start pushing a little bit harder.
"
Person0,"We have expanded the capacity -- we've put in the infrastructure in place at One Earth as part of that $16 million that we mentioned.
"
Person1,"Yes, that's correct.
