Person,Sentence
Person2,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"It's more on-premise first, really looking at how they can optimize their spend to drive more consumption of Teradata to meet their internal users' needs and drive more business values.
"
Person2,"So the first one is that on-prem.
"
Person2,"And the second one, I would say, is our managed cloud.
"
Person2,"And we see continued interest in that managed cloud offerings.
"
Person2,"So those would be the two -- we just came out with MPP on AWS in Q3.
"
Person2,"And we do have, now, larger customers evaluating that solution as part of their hybrid cloud solution.
"
Person2,"And so, again, you'll hear more of that in the strategy at the Analyst Day.
"
Person2,"But that's how I would characterize the activity in Q3 and what I see the funnel in Q4.
"
Person2,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"We've always had -- to answer directly first, is that we have not made any wholesale changes to the comp structure during the year.
"
Person2,"But our objective in 2016 was to really keep it comp neutral to the salesperson to drive the right solution for the customer.
"
Person2,"So again, out there our sales people know that they'll be treated fairly with the compensation strategy driving the right solution for the customer.
"
Person2,"And we are working on our comp programs to really align them entirely to our strategy effective 1/1/17.
"
Person2,"And it will continuing to be an evolving process.
"
Person2,"But again, we have had these offerings in the past.
"
Person2,"They were more unique to a particular sets of customers.
"
Person2,"So we understood the economic dynamics of those transactions for our customer and for our sales teams.
"
Person2,"And we kept it to be very comp neutral to them to drive the right solution for the customer.
"
Person2,"So, again, you'll be -- we'll be continuing to refine those and rolling those out in a more specific way start of 2017.
"
Person2,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Yes, we did the -- the alignment was actually done in December of 2015 where we, particularly in the US, the Americas markets, where we realigned from an industry focus to a more geographical focus.
"
Person2,"That was a very significant realignment.
"
Person2,"And that was completed and put into place at the beginning of this year.
"
Person2,"We're not anticipating any other significant realignments going forward.
"
Person2,"We're working within that geographical structure.
"
Person2,"But what you'll see is, we continue to evolve in our go-to-market.
"
Person2,"We will align existing resources, and we're looking at hiring additional resources in the cloud area.
"
Person2,"And again, we're aligning our resources -- continuing to align and refine our resources back to that geographical model that we put in place at the start of 2016.
"
Person2,"So no significant realignments in 2016.
"
Person2,"And I'm not factoring in any, again, because there's no significant realignments, there's no unusual activity that I'm forecasting or outlooking in Q4 of 2016.
"
Person2,"Again, on our Analyst Day, you'll hear more information on our go-to-market strategy.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Again, we're very early stages.
"
Person2,"It is our larger customers that are evaluating those alternatives.
"
Person2,"But there's no -- I can't come up and say there's a particular trend.
"
Person2,"It is predominantly with our larger US-based customers.
"
Person2,"But again, we're not restricting these types of solutions just to the US customers.
"
Person2,"It's on a global basis.
"
Person2,"So again, very early stages.
"
Person2,"You'll hear more on our assumptions behind those conversions at the Analyst Day and how that would impact our long-term financial model.
"
Person2,"So thank you.
"
Person2,"Although the last few years -- I just want to share a couple of words here in closing.
"
Person2,"Although the last few years have been challenging for Teradata from a revenue growth perspective, our technology, again, remains unchallenged in the market and highly regarded by our customers.
"
Person2,"The key element of our future success is to drive more consumption of Teradata, no matter where or how deployed, in the public cloud, in our managed cloud, or as a subscription, or on premise.
"
Person2,"We're also emphasizing our ability to generate quantifiable business value for business users at our customers.
"
Person2,"This is something that has become less of a focus in the last few years.
"
Person2,"Going forward, we plan to become more business outcome led and technology enabled.
"
Person2,"We have great foundation in our technology, our customers, and most importantly our people to support our strategy.
"
Person2,"And everyone is passionate on our renewed focus of winning.
"
Person2,"At the center of this focus is alignment and execution.
"
Person2,"Our long-term strategy, which you'll hear on our Analyst Day, aligns with our clear vision.
"
Person2,"Our current year operational imperatives are aligned with our long-term strategy, all of which will be measured by actionable metrics to drive consistent execution and accountability across the organization, and drive business value for our customers.
"
Person2,"Again, we'll provide more information on all of these actions at our Analyst Day on November 17.
"
Person2,"And I look forward to seeing you there.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
