Person,Sentence
Person1,"<UNK>, I don't have the occupancies or any of that stuff on the acquisitions here with me.
"
Person1,"They are generally somewhere between 70% and 85% occupied.
"
Person1,"In terms of price per foot, the stuff required were about $110, $120 a foot.
"
Person1,"It varies by market.
"
Person2,"Lower.
"
Person2,"You're welcome.
"
Person1,"Well, London and Paris -- you know, first of all, those are big markets.
"
Person1,"I assume you're talking about the major Metro centers, London, Paris, Berlin.
"
Person1,"Yes, they are just like Los Angeles or San Francisco or Manhattan.
"
Person1,"I mean, you've got core, core markets, the inner ring in Paris, downtown near Buckingham palace, the central part of London.
"
Person1,"First of all, you can't get zoning.
"
Person1,"Second of all, if you -- if a piece of land is for sale, it's incredibly expensive, probably doesn't make sense.
"
Person1,"So it's equally as tough.
"
Person1,"And the sites we've done in London are -- they have not been easy in terms of getting the zoning.
"
Person1,"Same challenges that you face here, where the markets where you really, really want to be in and there's no competition, it's really hard or there's no zoning.
"
Person1,"Well, you got to keep in mind in all of <UNK>tern Europe and, again, this is best guess statistics, somewhere between [1500] and 1800 facilities in all of <UNK>tern Europe, including Great Britain, over half of which are in Great Britain.
"
Person1,"So the product that's available across the continent is pretty thin.
"
Person1,"There's not a lot of -- I think in Berlin, there's 10, 12 facilities in all of Berlin.
"
Person1,"So there's not a lot to buy and the product is on average, I would say, much lower quality than the US because a lot of it was not purpose-built.
"
Person1,"A lot of it was converted office, converted garages, converted industrial buildings.
"
Person1,"And it takes a variety of shapes and sizes.
"
Person1,"So not a lot of purpose-built product in Europe.
"
Person1,"Not a lot of product to even buy.
"
Person1,"And most the product there is over in Great Britain and a lot of it's outside London.
"
Person0,"Thank you for participating on our call and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.
"
Person0,"Have a good afternoon.
