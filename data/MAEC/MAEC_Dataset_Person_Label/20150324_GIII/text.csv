Person1,"The size of the deal is, yes, it's pretty consistent.
"
Person1,"That's our comfort zone, and that's not to say that we couldn't reach out further.
"
Person1,"But our comfort zone is between $0.5 billion to $1 billion level, also depending on the balance sheet that we would be acquiring.
"
Person1,"So the growth, or I guess your question is what is our strategy for some of the Jones space.
"
Person1,"We are in the middle of several situations, none of which have crossed the finish line.
"
Person1,"What we have a habit of doing is we look at several things simultaneously.
"
Person1,"As we all know, many pieces, or businesses, or opportunities fall away.
"
Person1,"So our strategy is not to take on more than we can handle, but to look at quite a bit, to be selective and make the best deal for ourselves and our shareholders.
"
Person1,"And we are near a couple of opportunities that are there for us, and whether they are licensed or acquisitions, our desire would be an acquisition.
"
Person1,"But that's not to say if an appropriate license was there, or a combination, if a partnership was there, we would concede our absolute wish which was to acquire brands and just take part of a brand or a license that's favorable to us.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"As I look at the two big pieces of the business, <UNK>, I would tell you that it's probably pretty comparable, both in terms of wholesale and retail.
"
Person0,"We're probably looking for a pretty similar increases in both sides of the business.
"
Person0,"In terms of operating margin improvement, we are forecasting some operating margin improvement, and I think that's going to also come from both the gross margin, slight improvements in both gross margin and the SG&A.
"
Person0,"When we think about the Bass business, we've got lots of room in terms of gross margin improvement, as well as SG&A leverage.
"
Person0,"A little less room in terms of improving the gross margin performance of our wholesale business.
"
Person0,"It did perform extremely strongly this past year.
"
Person0,"We're up in the high-single-digits in terms of operating margin improvement.
"
Person0,"So as sort of a recap of the whole thing, I think we will have balanced growth across the business and we'll see some nice improvements in terms of both gross margin, as well as SG&A.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I think I'd like to add that we are all focused on what might be considered our new toy, and that would be Bass.
"
Person1,"What we're not focusing on is everything that's still left on the table for us at Calvin Klein.
"
Person1,"This brand, although it is our largest business, and one might look at it and say where are you going to go with this.
"
Person1,"The opportunity with Calvin Klein is endless.
"
Person1,"There's not a classification that we are not projecting good growth in for the coming year.
"
Person1,"Surprisingly, and I think I touched on it earlier, it doesn't necessarily have to be that there is another brand to replace Jones New York.
"
Person1,"There can be an existing brand that just has gotten so good and so broad at what they do, that they are able to garner a disproportionate amount of space and the amount of the budget that's out there for growth.
"
Person1,"The focus, again, as we described earlier on areas that seem to be matured, is better design -- design at Calvin Klein in each classification is best-in-class, dress designs are as good as they get.
"
Person1,"When you think you've reached the limit, you shop the next collection and you say, oh, my God, how did it get better.
"
Person1,"When you look at our bag business, all we need is more space.
"
Person1,"We have great product.
"
Person1,"Our battles today are trying to create more space to display all the great stuff that we do.
"
Person1,"Our suit business, we are doing amazingly well with it.
"
Person1,"We have, again, a solid design team.
"
Person1,"We have a fan base at retail that is supporting it and we clearly dominate that area.
"
Person1,"We brought that area back to life.
"
Person1,"Coats, there's not very much that I can say about coats that I haven't said.
"
Person1,"It's design, it's price, it's quality, it's cooperation from your vendor base.
"
Person1,"We have it all for Calvin Klein.
"
Person1,"If you were going to look at this Company, a big percentage of our growth is still available through further development of Calvin Klein.
"
Person1,"Globally, in its lifecycle, I think they've got a long way to go.
"
Person1,"This brand will survive and will prosper.
"
Person1,"There's nothing that one could guarantee about a hiccup.
"
Person1,"A hiccup might occur based on an environment, based on a change in management or design, but, and maybe it's just a little bit of time that cures it all.
"
Person1,"This is an amazing brand that's owned and operated by an amazing company.
"
Person1,"So our belief -- we are making a big bet that this brand is here forever.
"
Person1,"Hopefully, the team that's currently running it is there forever.
"
Person1,"They are highly competent.
"
Person1,"I guess I might be hearing your concern about the Warnaco piece that was acquired.
"
Person1,"That was acquired, it's just taking a little longer than expected to integrate the company.
"
Person1,"We've had those issues.
"
Person1,"We continue to have it.
"
Person1,"We over planned for Bass this fourth quarter, but we're fixing it.
"
Person1,"And the same goes for PVH.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much for hearing our story and I wish you a good day.
"
