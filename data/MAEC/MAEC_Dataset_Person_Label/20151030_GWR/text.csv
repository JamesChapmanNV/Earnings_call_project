Person1,"Right now we are about 3.5 times.
"
Person1,"Assuming no other acquisitions, just assume that the free cash flow generation that we have next year is all used for paying down debt.
"
Person2,"That's one way to look at it.
"
Person2,"And that is going to give you something closer to 3 times.
"
Person2,"It is all math at that point.
"
Person1,"Yes, no, I mean it's a -- are you seeing new trends.
"
Person1,"I mean, our trends are so negative that is kind of hard; you're talking about relative degrees of negativity.
"
Person1,"And so I think about it versus prior expectations back in August.
"
Person1,"What you see in our fourth-quarter outlook is some softening in paper due to some rationalization in that industry, with some plants being taken down in the fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"And we've seen some softening in the steel order books.
"
Person1,"And we've seen the price of gas drop very low, which makes you a little nervous about your coal.
"
Person1,"And you have seen our coal outlook come down accordingly.
"
Person1,"And so those are -- in terms of what you are comparing that AAR data to in our world, we have seen some of that softness, and that is cast in our outlook right now.
"
Person1,"Well, you know, you actually -- we've had good visibility into when mines have been closing and are accordingly able to very carefully adjust our cost structure.
"
Person1,"If you look at our Australian results, we've made some huge adjustments in order to mitigate the losses of a tremendous amount of iron ore revenue, and part of that is because of the visibility to when those mine closures took place.
"
Person1,"And then the redeployment of the equipment -- it depends on the service, but in some cases you are able to cascade certain newer equipment to replace older equipment and realize immediate efficiencies in that regard.
"
Person1,"And then you look at, through that cascade, perhaps deploying that excess equipment to bidding on new business in other geographies in other sectors that are not as -- you know, Australia does not just produce iron ore.
"
Person1,"There is a lot of other stuff that is shipping there.
"
Person1,"So we -- and it is open access, so you're able to take that equipment with limitations on gauge and geography to some degree, and participate in other parts of the market.
"
Person1,"So it's -- there is -- we are constantly attentive to it, worrying about it, thinking about it, and have been able to make the adjustments really on a real-time basis, as you can see in the numbers.
"
Person1,"The Australian team has done a very good job.
"
Person1,"I mean, there parallel projects that we have not talked about on the outside.
"
Person1,"But some of the reasons the costs have come down is we have done things like we completely insourced all track maintenance.
"
Person1,"We completely insourced all mechanical maintenance.
"
Person1,"And with that, we've been able to bring the productivity and the cost structure down as well.
"
Person1,"So there is -- these savings don't just happen.
"
Person1,"They are requiring a lot of advanced planning and work.
"
Person1,"No, it should be -- all the stuff I am talking about is just incremental.
"
Person1,"That is why you speak to it very comfortably, because you are taking a fixed cost and turning it into a piece of business immediately.
"
Person1,"Well, it depends on how you allocate costs.
"
Person1,"But it is actually a lower-margin business, and that is not obvious right now, because you've got a bunch of lease costs that are fixed right now that you are absorbing.
"
Person1,"But if you actually look at it, that is the more competitive part of the market in that area.
"
Person1,"So it is the least painful part of the business to lose.
"
Person1,"Great, well, thank you all for joining us this morning.
"
Person1,"And we look forward to speaking with you on the next call.
"
