Person0,"Again ATLAS, I don't want to at this time to set up the timeline, but our plan is to take it to the FDA before the end of -- so to clinical trial before the end of the second quarter.
"
Person0,"And we have like 12 sites that will be running it, so somewhere before the end of 2017 and can be also based on 2018, we will submit or will be submitting to the FDA.
"
Person0,"So at this stage I don't want really to provide exactly date because it really depend on us weekly will run those 12 sites and et cetera.
"
Person0,"But again, I just want to emphasize that from my point of view, the ATLAS, as we call it now, is a nice instrument, but we have over there very nice instrument which is [Verigene].
"
Person0,"And obviously the Verigene is the most simple to use and combine two boxes into one, but the sales force have always with the Verigene, so I'd like them to continue to push the Verigene into the market, and when ATLAS will come, it will come.
"
Person0,"So my focus now and the focus within the company the first is to deliver on the $45 million and continue to grow this number rapidly.
"
Person0,"Obviously, if we have Atlas in 2017, it will give us another boost to go to new customers and place some new systems there and obviously improve gross margin.
"
Person0,"Now concerning the Atella, it's not a big market opportunity as the rest of the assay -- I think the CDP, it's a large market opportunity obviously -- the group extract, et cetera -- but it's something else and the bag, something else to our salesforce to go and speak with the customers.
"
Person0,"And they opening a few more doors for there is potential, as I said earlier, to grow it in a more than end full of million dollars this year.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"Within our guidance, <UNK>, is the expectation they'd be gone by the middle of this year.
"
Person1,"That's in the center of our guidance.
"
Person1,"Obviously, if they stay a little longer -- that was contemplated as our guidance -- upper end of the guidance, and not likely they'd leave earlier, so the bottom end of the guidance certainly doesn't incorporate that.
"
Person1,"As far as a dollar amount, we haven't said what the dollar amount is.
"
Person0,"First we said it earlier this year when we pre-release the result that we got into a 92, a 93 system.
"
Person0,"Since then we got a few more, so I think we are very close to the 100.
"
Person0,"It's all over.
"
Person0,"I mean, some of them head-to-head, some of them new accounts, some of them we got some accounts that we were not there and they were Nanosphere accounts, so that's actually working very nice to us that Nanosphere opened the door to us.
"
Person0,"So it's all over.
"
Person0,"I can't point to you, but what is interesting to say that we are in a major site.
"
Person0,"So we are in a major site, and it's not kind of obscure site across the USA or outside the USA.
"
Person0,"And, by the way, the majority of the system, like 90% of the system, are installed in the USA, so it's a thing that we see that all the time because of reimbursement, et cetera, we'll see more adaptation for the system in the USA areas.
"
Person0,"Obviously in Japan, when we get the reimbursement for the Verigene, we will start seeing there also a big market growth in system placement.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Lutif, and thank you, everyone, for your attendance on our earnings call.
"
Person0,"We look forward to seeing you in person in the very near future.
"
Person0,"Have a great day.
