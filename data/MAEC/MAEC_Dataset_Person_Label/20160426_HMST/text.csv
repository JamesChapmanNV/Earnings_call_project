Person0,"Hey, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We do, internally.
"
Person0,"I think it's safe to assume that, given our guidance on loan growth, that that needs to be supported primarily with deposit growth.
"
Person0,"Right.
"
Person0,"We are right around 100% loan-to-deposits and we don't intend to go too far over that.
"
Person0,"It's important that we grow our deposits, consistent with our loan growth.
"
Person0,"Obviously, we have to be focused on funding, when you look at our strategy for growth.
"
Person0,"Part of that funding strategy will have to be made up with time deposits.
"
Person0,"We are seeking to keep that composition from rising much, though, that assumes that, as the total grows, the absolute total of time deposits, as well, will grow.
"
Person0,"More importantly, though, our branch-opening activity and retail strategy, along with our commercial banking strategies, expected to grow the lion's share of the deposits, going forward.
"
Person0,"We may add to that with acquisitions; we have in the past, of branches and deposits, and it's an opportunistic activity.
"
Person0,"Obviously, M&A can help that funding equation, as well and, we continue to look at deals that exist in the marketplaces in which we are interested, and so, I would expect that the answer to that lies both in organic growth and in M&A.
"
Person0,"It was -- there was a retail component.
"
Person0,"There was -- what would I call this one.
"
Person0,"It was an institutional component.
"
Person0,"There's an institution of peer-to-peer market for CDs that was a substantial part and then about $100 million of it was brokered.
"
Person0,"It's all in-house, directly originated.
"
Person0,"I'm sorry what.
"
Person0,"Right.
"
Person0,"I was excluding that.
"
Person0,"Our strategy does not include, nor need, secondary-market purchases of any loan type.
"
Person0,"It will be, but let me say about syndicated loans, at some point we will have some syndicated lending activity.
"
Person0,"To date, I think, now that I think about it, we did do one small syndicated participation.
"
Person0,"I think that will be opportunistic when really attractive deals come across the bow.
"
Person0,"Our business is primarily direct to the customer.
"
Person0,"That is purely commercial real estate; permanent commercial real estate lending in, primarily, multifamily.
"
Person0,"It's a local originator.
"
Person0,"But -- local originator, but with a Western States book of business.
"
Person0,"Good morning <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thank you for asking that.
"
Person0,"I have been beating up my internal people about how we report.
"
Person0,"If you look at our core-efficiency ratio I think we quoted it --
"
Person1,"It's on page 17 on the earnings release.
"
Person0,"So, this ratio excludes M&A-related expenses.
"
Person0,"It is more core.
"
Person0,"There are some others, sort of nonrecurring things, even things like intangibles amortization, that other people do not include in their calculation of operating efficiency, that we still do.
"
Person0,"But, we are expecting this ratio, the core ratio, to fall to the low 60% range by the fourth quarter of this year, mid to low 60%.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So, keep in mind, in this quarter, we had the overhang still from the remaining OCBB expenses that we will bring out.
"
Person1,"I should say this quarter, being the first quarter, relative to this quarter that will come out.
"
Person1,"We also had five new office openings in the quarter, so that impacted it.
"
Person0,"And, additional FICA expenses, seasonally.
"
Person1,"And additional FICA expenses.
"
Person1,"Now, you will see, in the second quarter, obviously, the full quarter impact of some of those additional offices from the first quarter, but as <UNK> mentioned, as we move throughout the course of the year we anticipate the efficiency ratio improving quite a bit.
"
Person0,"Correct.
"
Person0,"No, I take that back.
"
Person0,"The other significant item in the quarter was, really, the absence of any material loan sales or securities gains.
"
Person0,"If you look at the fourth quarter, as an example, we had eight-point-some million dollars of non-interest income, most of which $7 million or so, which was related to sales of Fannie Mae DUS loans, or SBA loans.
"
Person0,"We had very little of that activity in the first quarter, but we expect to have a substantial amount of that activity over the remainder of the year.
"
Person0,"So, you have two affects, both a change in operating expenses and a pretty substantial increase in revenue driving that change, that expected change in the operating-efficiency ratio.
"
Person0,"Consolidations, no.
"
Person0,"We have not -- we don't expect to acquire any that would be consolidatable.
"
Person0,"And those that we open are in new markets.
"
Person0,"It will, but not as quickly as revenue.
"
Person0,"So, we expect that operating leverage to not only improve earnings, but the ratios related to them, like operating efficiency.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We are expecting somewhere in excess of $200 million.
"
Person0,"Obviously, it depends on the market and market timing.
"
Person0,"We have seen premiums run from, let's say, 2% to 3%-plus.
"
Person1,"So, when you look at our net-interest-income sensitivity, we do see that we have more liabilities refunding and repricing in zero to three months than we do assets.
"
Person1,"A number of that is our federal home loan bank advances repricing, and then, the remainder would be to higher cost of deposits.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That's going to be -- it could be lumpy.
"
Person0,"The timing of not just the origination but the sale of loans may not be really even.
"
Person1,"I would say -- so, <UNK> mentioned, as well, that last quarter was a high-water mark, with respect to that non-interest income coming through that segment and the first quarter is a low-water mark, so, I think it's fair and reasonable to take the average of the two quarters, in terms of expectations, going forward.
"
Person1,"In total, in addition to the DUS sales, the other multifamily sales, as well.
"
Person0,"Right.
"
Person0,"So, depending upon the level of activity, that number could range from $2 million-$5 million, depending on the quarter.
"
Person0,"Including multi, right - sort of all in - and, including SBA, actually.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"It's a little bit typical seasonality.
"
Person0,"The fourth quarter, typically, has a lot of activity, loans that investors or buyers of property, or people refinancing, want to get concluded by year end, so there is always a rush to close as much of the pipeline as possible for customer purposes, as well as our own.
"
Person0,"And, typically, in the first quarter, there are not as many sales transactions.
"
Person0,"People are just starting the year and activity is seasonally slower.
"
Person0,"So, we expect the remainder of the year to be more typical, seasonally, with higher activity.
"
Person0,"But the fourth quarter is always busier, and the first quarter is typically slower.
"
Person0,"So, for the Orange County Business Bank acquisition, we are still expecting that acquisition to be accretive this year.
"
Person0,"Some 3%.
"
Person0,"We will have some transition expenses in the second quarter, but by the end of the second quarter, all of the expense savings will have been realized.
"
Person0,"So, from third quarter forward, we should be at the run rate we expect out of that acquisition.
"
Person0,"With respect to de nova branch openings, that occurs over a more lengthy time frame, because it's related to the acquisition of deposits in the marketplace.
"
Person0,"Typically, we expect branches to be breaking even, depending on how you calculate the interest rate associated with the deposit, at about two years.
"
Person0,"Fully-funded, or fully grown, I guess, in about five years.
"
Person0,"Our branch has been running ahead of that number, typically, I think all but two cases are well ahead of the deposit acquisition pace that we expect.
"
Person0,"So, with respect to new branches, that is the timeframe.
"
Person0,"With respect to other positions that may relate to corporate infrastructure, they may not be revenue-producing positions, but they may have to be added as consequence of our growth, so those ads are related to current growth in other areas.
"
Person0,"It might be in compliance or legal or county finance, some of these areas -- Human Resources -- that ultimately become sort of size denominated.
"
Person0,"Our lending centers, however, are expected to be profitable within a couple of months of opening, so any of our expansion expenses invested in new lending centers, whether it be single-family, homebuilding or commercial real estate, are expected to be profitable in a relatively short period of time.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Again, we appreciate your patience your attention this morning.
"
Person0,"All of the great questions.
"
Person0,"We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
