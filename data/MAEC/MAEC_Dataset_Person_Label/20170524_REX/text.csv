Person0,"Good morning, and thank you for joining REX American Resources' Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Conference Call.
"
Person0,"We'll get to our presentation and comments momentarily as well as your Q&<UNK>
"
Person0,"But first, I'll review the safe harbor disclosure.

"
Person0,"REX American Resources assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
"
Person0,"I have joining me on the call today, <UNK> <UNK>, the Executive Chairman of the Board; and <UNK> <UNK>, Chief Executive Officer.
"
Person0,"I will first review our financial performance and then turn the call over to <UNK> for his comments.
"
Person0,"Sales for the quarter increased 12.9%, primarily due to increased ethanol pricing and production.
"
Person0,"Sales were based upon 63.3 million gallons this year versus 58.7 million gallons in the prior year first quarter.
"
Person0,"Dried distiller grains sales were down $1.9 million or approximately 11%, reflecting a $25 per ton decrease in pricing.
"
Person0,"Gross profit increased 48% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
"
Person0,"The crush spread was approximately $0.23 in the current year versus approximately $0.10 in the prior year.
"
Person0,"The gross profit was positively impacted by ethanol pricing and volume, but negatively impacted by DDG pricing as well as natural gas pricing.
"
Person0,"SG&A increased in the first quarter from $4 million to $5.4 million, primarily reflecting increased railcar repair costs as well as higher professional fees and incentive comp.
"
Person0,"Equity method income for the first quarter increased from $233,000 to $700,000, primarily reflecting improved industry dynamics for the first quarter over the prior-year first quarter.
"
Person0,"Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 34.5% net of minority interests, which approximates to prior year first quarter rate.
"
Person0,"Our net income for the quarter increased 60% to $4.5 million versus $2.8 million in the prior year.
"
Person0,"Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69 versus $0.43.
"
Person0,"I'll now turn the call over to <UNK> for his comments.
"
Person1,"Good morning, everybody.
"
Person1,"During the first quarter 2017, we made total capital investment of approximately $5.9 million and to date approximately $9.3 million.
"
Person1,"We added ferm tanks, boiler, cooling towers, centrifuge and energy-saving equipment.
"
Person1,"These are the main capital investments we had.
"
Person1,"The construction work is now rapidly progressing and is expected to be completed by the beginning of fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"As we continue to increase ethanol production, we will continue to monitor crush margin.
"
Person1,"NuGen is also producing export-grade ethanol.
"
Person1,"NuGen sold more than 19 million gallons of export-grade ethanol this year, compared to last year, we sold about 8 plus million.
"
Person1,"So as the construction will increase, and I think it also depends on the weather and how the weather, rain, continues, but we expect that by the end -- by the fourth quarter, construction will be completed, and at that time we will start producing close to a 150 million gallon rate.
"
Person1,"I think as <UNK> mentioned about the exports, since I said we are exporting it, we expect the ethanol export will increase to Brazil, Canada, Mexico and India.
"
Person1,"Mexico will be potentially replacing MTBE.
"
Person1,"Ethanol export for the first quarter of 2017 was 387 million gallons, according to Renewable Fuel Association.
"
Person1,"Export to Brazil for first 4 months of this year totaled 220 million gallons compared to only 59.2 million gallons during the last -- during last year in the same period.
"
Person1,"So we expect that this year export will be approximately 1.3 billion gallon or more.
"
Person1,"<UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes, that's right.
"
Person1,"First quarter, we spent about $5.9 million.
"
Person1,"But I think to date, we have $9.3 million.
"
Person1,"So construction work continues.
"
Person1,"And we expect by the fourth quarter, we will be able to start full production.
"
Person1,"And as you know, again, it depends on a lot of things, also on weather and some of the equipment delays.
"
Person1,"So -- but that's what we're hoping, by that time we will complete.
"
Person1,"I think we have -- as we said previously, it will about $10 million to $15 million for each location.
"
Person1,"So we are expecting somewhere $20 million to $30 million for the both of them.
"
Person1,"And I think that will lead us to production of growth of to 150 million gallon.
"
Person1,"Correct.
"
Person1,"Each, yes.
"
Person1,"Not really.
"
Person1,"I think that what we have done this -- this is also our shutdown month because with both locations, we shut down in the month of May.
"
Person1,"When we shut down during that period, we added extra tie-ins, and when you try to do a tie-in, and then some equipment was added this month, so it took a little bit longer for us to come back into full production than normally, after the shutdown we come back.
"
Person1,"So that certainly affected some in this month.
"
Person1,"But we try to do all this tie-in during the shutdown.
"
Person1,"But otherwise, no, it does not affect overall our production.
"
Person0,"Thanks you, operator.
"
Person0,"Thank you, everyone, and we very much appreciate your listening to us.
"
Person0,"And we'll talk to you again at the end of next quarter.
"
Person0,"Thank you so much.
"
Person0,"Bye.
"
