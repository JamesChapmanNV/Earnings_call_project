Person0,"Outside of -- somewhat, yes.
"
Person0,"Our footprint really goes to just down south to Ocala, but we've hired some producers in Tampa.
"
Person0,"We are doing something in Charlotte.
"
Person0,"We would look close -- let me say, close to the footprint.
"
Person0,"I don't think you'll see us in Boston, or out west in Dallas, or San Francisco, but close to our footprint in Southern states, I believe we would be willing to do that.
"
Person0,"We finished with 10 SBA bankers, and we're looking to get that to 15, and so the idea that we might have to go a little further out of our footprint, like I was saying, I think we're okay with doing that.
"
Person1,"I would point out that we're still well within the guideline number and I think, <UNK>, it was 207% at the end of the quarter CRE.
"
Person1,"So from the standpoint of concentrations, we've managed to well within the guidance.
"
Person1,"So overall, the risk profile is not what it was in our bank in the last downturn.
"
Person1,"And C&D was less than two-thirds of the guidance.
"
Person1,"So from a macro level, we're in a really good place, if we wanted to get more aggressive in a particular market, or with an M&A target that was concentrated, we have the flexibility and the leeway to do that.
"
Person1,"I think -- I don't know that we've seen any signs of a particular market we're in, that alarms us.
"
Person1,"Clearly, there's segments within the market that we see overheated, and that we've avoided, and that would vary by market, but we've also seen -- and multi-housing is one of them.
"
Person1,"But we've also seen a couple of those deals that -- and markets that made us pretty excited.
"
Person1,"So overall, we're in a really good place.
"
Person1,"We don't see any market that's a big concern at this point, with our portfolio.
"
Person0,"Generally, I don't know, it's just trends in NSFs and debit interchange.
"
Person0,"A lot of times we actually even see third-quarter debit interchange higher than the fourth quarter, when you think there would be more transactions.
"
Person0,"But for us, generally, the third quarter's been our highest quarter.
"
Person0,"This quarter, we did change, and we mentioned it in the press release, we tweaked a few service charge routines, and that's what drove service charges a little higher.
"
Person0,"We made a comment before about what that was, and that was, we initiated a small service charge for paper statements.
"
Person0,"And so I think over the next couple quarters, that might trend a little lower, as those customers select online banking, and don't select the paper charge.
"
Person0,"But for now, that's what drove that a little.
"
Person0,"That's what drove that in the third quarter.
"
Person0,"The dollar level should stay flat, maybe move up a hair, but not enough to drive anything.
"
Person0,"In that the source of liquidity would be the mortgage pool, versus securities.
"
Person0,"Probably $200 million a year is a good assumption.
"
Person0,"That's correct.
"
Person0,"Of what's closed but not sold.
"
Person0,"I don't think -- it's not half.
"
Person0,"I've been -- for <UNK>, I mean, my reports to <UNK> on that have shown us about 40% of that going away.
"
Person0,"Of course we think -- and obviously, <UNK>, we obviously think we can grow that between here and $10 billion, so the effect is probably -- dollar-wise will be more, but just looking at today's dollars, it should be about 40%.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"All right.
"
Person0,"Thanks again for everyone that has joined.
"
Person0,"If you have any questions or comments, <UNK> and I both are available, e-mail or telephone.
"
Person0,"Thanks, and have a great week.
"
