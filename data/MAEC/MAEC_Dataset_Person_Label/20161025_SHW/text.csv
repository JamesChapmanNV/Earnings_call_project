Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I think it does, <UNK>, and that's the point that I made.
"
Person1,"I know I keep beating the same drum, but it's what gives us confidence about the model in 2017 and our ability to continue to drive operating margins going forward.
"
Person1,"You're exactly right.
"
Person2,"No, I think the spending has been pretty consistent like we talked about in the second quarter, it was maybe different programs.
"
Person2,"But with -- around the other edges of SG&A they did a nice job of controlling their cost, and we talked about the mix in that business that helped, so I think that's what is driving the margin.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we use third-party contractors and they do a variety of things for our customers.
"
Person2,"These previously immaterial amounts (inaudible), we said net them in SG&A, we determined that the billing for the customer should have been grossed up in sales, but the payment to the contractors including the cost of goods sold in it for net immaterial impact on gross profit.
"
Person2,"It does reduce our gross margin and does it decrease our operating margin and what we talked about is, we did it prospectively in the third quarter, so we only booked it for the third quarter.
"
Person2,"We'll do that in the fourth quarter, that will have a similar small impact and then in the first and second quarters of 2017.
"
Person2,"So 2017 full year won't have any impact.
"
Person2,"You're welcome.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Jessie.
"
Person0,"As always I will be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call.
"
Person0,"As call volume is already very heavy I appreciate your patience.
"
Person0,"I will make every effort to get back to you on a timely basis.
"
Person0,"I'd like to thank you again for joining us today and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.
