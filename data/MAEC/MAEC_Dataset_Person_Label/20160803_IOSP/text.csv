Person1,"Again, I will go back to three years ago when we presented our strategy and we continue to do that, we said we wanted a balance portfolio.
"
Person1,"And if you look at this acquisition and then you take -- if oil -- when oil returns to the mid-$50s to $60, you have really got a very balanced portfolio, anywhere from $350 million to $400 million in personal care, anywhere from $250 million to $400 million, depending on the market changes in oil field, and a $500 million fuels business.
"
Person1,"That is a great balanced portfolio with great technology.
"
Person1,"So for us, we don't really need to run out and acquire anymore.
"
Person1,"I think we have got very good strategy.
"
Person1,"We have got -- for us, now it is fund organic growth and technology and look at expansion of the dividend.
"
Person1,"If something comes along, I don't think you will see anything to this magnitude.
"
Person1,"If it is, it might be a small geographic area where we have a technology or we need growth, inorganic expansion, for instance, something maybe in Saudi.
"
Person1,"But, for us, we are really well-positioned now to really not go out and do much acquisitions.
"
Person1,"Multiples have come down, but I think what we have seen in the market is what has been for sale has not been a business that really does anything for us long-term.
"
Person1,"It might be a consolidation of assets, and we really don't need more assess at this time.
"
Person1,"I think for us, we will continue to look at oil field, especially if it is geographic growth.
"
Person1,"And I think there probably will be some small either geographic expansions and/or product expansions.
"
Person1,"But we are properly positioned in the right growth areas in the US market, specifically.
"
Person1,"I think it is more so just general organic growth expansion, whether it is putting more plant capacity in or personnel as we get the business.
"
Person1,"That is our focus right now.
"
Person1,"Yes, it was both.
"
Person1,"Sorry.
"
Person1,"Good question.
"
Person1,"It was both.
"
Person1,"It was not only growth in the US market specific, but again, as we stated in the last Q call that there is a customer that we started to deliver to in South America, and that is part of the growth as well.
"
Person1,"And that should continue.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Yes, there was.
"
Person1,"If you look at the Huntsman business, Huntsman -- they run good plants.
"
Person1,"They have good people.
"
Person1,"They have are very good operators, which is good for us.
"
Person1,"We are not picking up a business that has been destroyed or in disarray.
"
Person1,"It has been a very stable business for Huntsman.
"
Person1,"I think it is going to be a very stable business for us.
"
Person1,"The same general competitors are out there.
"
Person1,"The good thing is that we don't have to put a lot of money of CapEx for expansion into these plants.
"
Person1,"We have got more than enough room, and I think with the additional volume in technology that we are bringing to Europe from the US should help grow that volume in those plants.
"
Person1,"So I think overall, as a competitive situation, we sit in a good position, along with all the other competitors.
"
Person1,"I think it is a pretty responsible market.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"It is apples and oranges.
"
Person1,"If you look at that [Palmers] business, it has been like that for the last 15 years up and down.
"
Person1,"This is a pretty stable business.
"
Person1,"Thank you all for joining us today, and thanks to all our shareholders, customers, and Innospec employees for your interest and support.
"
Person1,"If you have any further questions about Innospec or matters discussed on this call, please give us a call.
"
Person1,"We look forward to meeting up with you later again this year.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
