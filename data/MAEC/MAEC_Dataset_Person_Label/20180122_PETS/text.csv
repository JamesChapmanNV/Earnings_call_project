"

"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
"
Person1,"Today, we will review the highlights of our financial results.
"
Person1,"We'll compare our third fiscal quarter and 9 months ended on December 31, 2017, to last year's quarter and 9 months ended on December 31, 2016.
"
Person1,"For the third fiscal quarter ended on December 31, 2017, our sales were $60.1 million compared to sales of $52.9 million for the same period the prior year, an increase of 13.7%.
"
Person1,"For the 9 months ended on December 31, 2017, sales were $206.5 million compared to sales of $186.1 million for the 9 months the last year, an increase of 10.9%.
"
Person1,"The increases in sales were due to increases in new order and reorder sales.
"
Person1,"The average order value for the quarter was approximately $86 compared to $81 for the same quarter the prior year.
"
Person1,"For the third fiscal quarter, net income was $9.1 million or $0.44 diluted per share compared to $4.8 million or $0.24 diluted per share for the same quarter the prior year, an increase to net income of 88%.
"
Person1,"For the 9 months, net income was $27.1 million or $1.33 diluted per share compared to $16.3 million or $0.80 diluted per share a year ago, an increase to net income of 66%.
"
Person1,"The accelerated increase in net income was mainly due to higher gross profit margins.
"
Person1,"In addition, the new tax law helped boost our earnings for the quarter by approximately $1.7 million or $0.08 diluted per share.
"
Person1,"New order sales increased by 15.5% to $9.2 million for the quarter compared to $7.9 million for the same period the prior year.
"
Person1,"For the 9 months, the new order sales increased by 12.7% to $36 million compared to $31.9 million for the same period last year.
"
Person1,"Reorder sales increased by 13.4% to $50.9 million for the quarter compared to reorder sales of $44.9 million for the same quarter the prior year.
"
Person1,"For the 9 months, the reorder sales increased by 10.6% to $170.5 million compared to $154.2 million for the same period a year ago.
"
Person1,"We acquired approximately 106,000 new customers in our third fiscal quarter compared to 99,000 for the same period the prior year.
"
Person1,"And we acquired approximately 408,000 new customers in the 9 months compared to 388,000 for the same period a year ago.
"
Person1,"For the quarter, approximately 84% of our sales were generated on our website compared to 83% for the same quarter last year, which resulted in a 15% increase in online sales.
"
Person1,"The seasonality in our business is due to the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in our product mix.
"
Person1,"Spring and summer are considered peak seasons, with fall and winter being the off-seasons.
"
Person1,"For the third fiscal quarter, our gross profit as a percent of sales was 36.5% compared to 31.5% for the same period a year ago.
"
Person1,"For the 9 months, our gross profit as a percent of sales was 35.3% compared to 30.7% for the 9 months a year ago.
"
Person1,"The shift in sales to new-generation medications with higher margin, the trend we have seen in the prior 3 quarters, continued in the December quarter.
"
Person1,"Our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was 9.7% for the quarter compared to 10.1% for the same quarter of the prior year.
"
Person1,"And for the 9 months, it was 8.8% compared to 9.2% for the same period a year ago.
"
Person1,"We were able to leverage the G&A with increased sales.
"
Person1,"For the quarter, we spent $4.1 million in advertising compared to $3.2 million for the same quarter the prior year, an increase of 30%.
"
Person1,"For the 9 months, we spent $14.9 million for advertising compared to $13.3 million for the 9 months a year ago, an increase of 12%.
"
Person1,"We increased advertising to stimulate new order sales.
"
Person1,"Advertising cost of acquiring a customer for the quarter was $39 compared to $32 for the same quarter the prior year.
"
Person1,"And for the 9 months, it was $37 compared to $34 for the 9 months the prior year.
"
Person1,"The increase is mainly due to increases in advertising costs.
"
Person1,"We had $81 million in cash and cash equivalents and $21.9 million in inventory, with no debt as of December 31, 2017.
"
Person1,"Net cash from operations for the 9 months was $35.1 million compared to $31.6 million for the 9 months last year.
"
Person1,"Due to the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we are anticipating an effective income tax rate of approximately 34% for the March 2018 quarter and approximately 24% for the next fiscal year.
"
Person1,"This ends the financial review.
"
Person1,"Operator, we're ready to take questions.
"
Person1,"During our off-peak season, typically gross margins are higher in the off-peak season than the peak season.
"
Person1,"So the comparisons are going to get tougher as we go along.
"
Person1,"So our gross margins increased in the last 4 quarters like 500 basis points, I guess, for the year.
"
Person1,"So it'll be tougher to continue that going forward.
"
Person1,"That is correct, yes.
"
Person1,"In the flea and tick category, there is a shift in sales from low-margin topicals to higher-margin, next-generation medications.
"
Person1,"And that's really the main reason for increase in the gross profit margins.
"
Person1,"Yes, there is a cost increase per impression, so I would anticipate that there's going to be some increase compared to the last year.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"I mean, as you know, we were a full 35% federal taxpayer.
"
Person0,"What we had been applying has been a 35% rate for the first half of the year, for the first 6 quarters.
"
Person0,"Once the tax law was enacted, we were allowed to prorate that rate, so we had 9 months at 35%, 1 month at 21%, which was a prorated 31.5%.
"
Person0,"We were able to apply that to the 9 months, and that's going to be the federal rate moving forward for the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"Once our fiscal year ends at March 31, 2018, we'll then apply for that full year of fiscal '19 a 21% federal rate.
"
Person0,"Right.
"
Person0,"That's the blended effective rate that includes state tax as well.
"
Person1,"And that includes state income tax.
"
Person1,"It's similar to the, I would say, prior 2 quarters.
"
Person1,"It's impacting our cost in advertising a little bit.
"
Person1,"That's one of the reasons the cost is up in advertising.
"
Person1,"Our relationships with our vendors are very good, I would say.
"
Person1,"There is some changes happening, but we may disclose that in our 10-K in May.
"
Person1,"Direct relationships.
"
Person1,"As far as access to products, I mean, we're -- we carry a full line of all the most popular pet medications.
"
Person1,"So, I mean, access isn't the sole issue.
"
Person1,"You're just talking about more direct relationships.
"
Person1,"With higher margins, we can afford to pay more to acquire a customer.
"
Person1,"So our thresholds have changed a little bit due to the higher margins.
"
Person1,"We are in maintenance stage now as far as capital deployment is concerned, as far as our infrastructure is concerned.
"
Person1,"But during normal course of business, we do look at opportunities.
"
Person1,"So if something happens, obviously, you guys will hear about it.
"
Person1,"I wouldn't call it an active.
"
Person1,"I would just say during normal course of business, we always looked at opportunities, and we'll continue to do that.
"
Person1,"We do have some sense, but I'm not going to share that with you.
"
Person1,"So I think the shift probably will continue for another couple years.
"
Person1,"We are working on the second generation of the app, which should go live, I believe, within the next 6 weeks.
"
Person1,"It's growing, but it's still not -- it's -- still it's in the infancy.
"
Person1,"But as the consumer using more and more of the mobile phones, we think it's going to be important for the future.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we'll continue to -- focusing on increasing sales and improving our service levels.
"
Person1,"This wraps up today's conference call.
"
Person1,"Thank you for joining us.
"
Person1,"Operator, this ends the conference call.
