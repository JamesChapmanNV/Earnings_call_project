Person0,"Great.
"
Person0,"Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call.
"
Person0,"As in recent quarters, we've issued our earnings release and an additional document to provide what we call further details and observations about our results.
"
Person0,"Again, my name is Jim <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I'm fulfilling the role of Interim President and Chief Executive Officer until the search for a permanent replacement is completed.
"
Person0,"A little background on me might be useful.
"
Person0,"I specialize in public and private corporate executive-level transitions with well-known names to mid-market firms.
"
Person0,"I also do some specific project work into what I would call targeted client risk areas.
"
Person0,"My career thus far includes some 40 years of experience in C-suite operational regulatory finance positions with large corporations and firms such as MCI, Telecom USA, Sprint, Arthur Andersen Business Consulting as well as others.
"
Person0,"For this group, I am not a candidate for the permanent role of President and CEO.
"
Person0,"From my vantage point, the board is focused on the search for that candidate and who likely will include tenure, skills, strategic industry and pedigree that fit their targeted preference.
"
Person0,"In the meantime, the board has charged me with assuring the company and management team operate on a business-as-usual approach throughout this transition.
"
Person0,"And a primary focus for me is assuring our business is conducted in a manner advantageous to our customers, to our employees and shareholders.
"
Person0,"So as for the business for this call, overall, our third quarter results were strong.
"
Person0,"We see positive momentum building and continued in our business as a result of a number of initiatives by the company.
"
Person0,"Our Chief Financial Officer, <UNK>ny <UNK>, is with me.
"
Person0,"And we're certainly welcome to take questions about our quarterly results.
"
Person1,"No, that's a Q4 event.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"There's -- obviously, there's been a press release on the activity by the board about the mutual separation.
"
Person0,"So yes, we see no reason to comment further on personal matters.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"So the tax rate will also shift due to the change in the tax law.
"
Person1,"So obviously, our corporate rate was 35%, and it's moving to 21%.
"
Person1,"For the current fiscal year, that's going to be a blended rate.
"
Person1,"But going forward, our effective tax rate will be more in the neighborhood of 24% to 25%.
"
Person1,"No, it's effective January 1, I believe, or maybe even a few days before that.
"
Person1,"Well, you're providing for the annual tax, right.
"
Person1,"So our fiscal year tax rate will be a blended rate of the 35% and the 21%.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Yes, there is some seasonality in Mexico, as you pointed out.
"
Person1,"As in Mexico, there's a kind of required Christmas bonus and -- that generally leads to pay downs and runoff in both portfolios.
"
Person1,"We have seen runoff in our Viva payroll deduct portfolio.
"
Person1,"As of the end of the quarter, our net receivables on the payroll deduct product after allowance is $16.9 million.
"
Person1,"The gross figure is $56.2 million.
"
Person1,"I believe we stated on the last call, we have stopped originating in our Viva product.
"
Person1,"And so the [amount of] delinquencies have remained relatively steady.
"
Person1,"So yes, a lot of delinquencies in the Viva portfolio.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"We feel like in the states we operate in today, there's still a lot of opportunity to open new branches.
"
Person0,"While there are states that look possible for us to move into, there's no immediate plans to move into those states.
"
Person0,"The plan right now is to continue to open branches in the space we operate in today.
"
Person0,"And it'll likely be similar to the current year where we open 30 -- 25 to 30 branches here in the U.S.
"
Person1,"So for the current year, the effective tax rate, again, this would be a blended rate of the 35% and the 21% that went into effect around the new year.
"
Person1,"Going forward, so starting in fiscal '19, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range.
"
Person1,"There was some shifting in expenses between Mexico and in the U.S. which would have some impact, but it's relatively minor.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Again, from my perspective and my conversations with the board, it's a very active future-looking group.
"
Person0,"I've grown to be impressed by their willingness to stay actively involved.
"
Person0,"In terms of the management team, again it's nice to walk into an organization that's got some stable management at the operational level.
"
Person0,"There's lots of things going on, and I feel good about that.
"
Person0,"In terms of the recent turnover, the function of the board is to always be taking a look at what does the leadership look like for now and going forward.
"
Person0,"And they've made some decisions along the way, and hence, the joint decision to part ways with the previous CEO.
"
Person0,"So I feel comfortable.
"
Person0,"Again, my charge is business as usual.
"
Person0,"But I've got a talented and knowledgeable group of board members to work with.
"
Person1,"I'm not sure I understand the question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"No, there's nothing we can elaborate on at this time.
"
Person1,"So as I mentioned to <UNK>, we have stopped originating in the Viva business.
"
Person1,"There's nothing more to add to that.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I think you can maybe assume that it is us taking market share, but it's hard to get a very clear view on that, just given that most of the companies in the industry are private companies.
"
Person1,"So it's hard to know what their growth rates are and what they're seeing to know that for sure.
"
Person1,"But we are encouraged by the strong growth in new customers and former customers.
"
Person1,"And they'll continue to be a focus as we move forward.
"
Person0,"And really some of our initiatives are concerned with retaining our base.
"
Person0,"We've got a good brand name where we are.
"
Person0,"And so the better service we can provide, hopefully, that might influence our ability to grow a little bit as well.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"As you know, around a year ago, we started to ramp up our internal collections efforts.
"
Person1,"And we've seen strong benefits from that.
"
Person1,"And since we started holding our 90-day accounts or longer, we have seen an increase in the rehabilitations of those customers.
"
Person1,"So it was something we felt good about, and the results seem to be playing out.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I won't elaborate too much, but I will say it was relatively small acquisition.
"
Person1,"It was only $350,000.
"
Person1,"Generally, the third quarter is pretty quiet for acquisitions, given most of these companies were in the middle of their growth season, and it's a profitable quarter for them.
"
Person1,"And you don't typically see people looking to sell in the third -- our third quarter, calendar fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"It's relatively small.
"
Person1,"So as you may recall, or may have seen, our live check program is focused on our former borrowers.
"
Person1,"We've rolled that out in the summer of last year.
"
Person1,"And obviously, since we're focusing on a former customer base, the response rates on those will go down over time as there's a limited number of people in that base.
"
Person1,"So while it's still a very helpful piece to our overall marketing program, it's not a significant piece of that program.
"
Person1,"I don't have it in front of me.
"
Person1,"But again, it's going to be a relatively small percentage of the overall base.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So our -- we typically renegotiate our facility in the springtime, so coming up in the next few months.
"
Person1,"I'm not going to elaborate on what we -- what the negotiating points may or may not be at this time.
"
Person1,"So the fourth quarter, I think it'll be in that 31% range.
"
Person1,"So just to clarify on why the quarterly effective tax rate was lower, a lot of that has to do with the first 2 quarters be that -- the 30 -- closer the 37% rate, and you have a true-up in the fourth quarter to adjust down to that 31% rate.
"
Person1,"So that's why the fourth quarter effective tax rate was a little lower.
"
Person1,"But for the full year, we expect to be closer to that 30%, 31%, 34% rate once you take into effect the state taxes.
"
Person1,"Correct.
"
Person0,"Well, great.
"
Person0,"Thanks for everybody's time and interest.
"
Person0,"We appreciate the opportunity to get in front of the group.
"
Person0,"And everybody, have a great day, and let's enjoy the warming weather, at least down here in the south.
"
