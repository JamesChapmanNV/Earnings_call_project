Person0,"So are you talking about income from operations Q2 2014 to Q2 2015.
"
Person1,"Well first, Dave, I just glanced back through really quickly.
"
Person1,"There have been quarters, I'm just looking at Q1 2012 versus Q2 2012, that was one where we stepped backwards quite a bit more.
"
Person1,"It was like 95.7% versus 92.3%, if my records here in front of me are correct.
"
Person1,"I talked a little bit about lifting this quarter.
"
Person1,"The ratio analysis seems to hold pretty well.
"
Person1,"Operating margins are, from a total operating expenses, to operating expenses, to cash collections are a little bit higher in Q2, which you might expect.
"
Person1,"I talked a little bit about some of the expenses, but there were some in Q1 as well.
"
Person1,"There's a few other expenses rummaging around in there that I didn't even point out.
"
Person1,"There's a $700,000 item that has to do with some charges we took over in Bromley, but I don't consider them restructuring.
"
Person1,"So there's a few other things in there.
"
Person1,"But I think the premise we have had quarters Q1 to Q2 where it stepped backwards, but that's about as far as I can go with that.
"
Person0,"Well the trend we tried to describe a couple times is really that we're seeing more people pay in our call centers.
"
Person0,"And one of the outcomes of that is fewer people get sent back into legal.
"
Person0,"So from a curve perspective, we'll have to make the curve higher sooner and get down faster later.
"
Person0,"Because there won't be the legal collection kick in the out years, but that's good news from us right.
"
Person0,"We like seeing cash come in faster, that improves IRR, so everyone is happy when that happens.
"
Person0,"No bad news.
"
Person1,"I'm sorry, <UNK>, it's in other income.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"That's correct.
"
Person0,"It's because of the way we had to structure that transaction and the securitization.
"
Person0,"So that particular investment, which was reasonably good size, doesn't show up in that traditional manner.
"
Person1,"It was $3 million in revenue this quarter.
"
Person1,"I don't have it off the top of my head what it was last quarter, probably similar, but I don't have it.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, do you want to give a little bit of color.
"
Person3,"No, we continued to look at the post market, we think it's an interesting marketplace for us.
"
Person3,"It's competitive, as all markets are now.
"
Person3,"But we see a regular stream of sales to the market.
"
Person3,"So we're building up our local organization there.
"
Person3,"And we opened up our Warsaw office, and tracking the market much closer.
"
Person0,"No, there's no further clarification that we're aware of at this point.
"
Person0,"Absolutely.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thank you all for joining us for the Q2 2015 PRA Group earnings call.
"
Person0,"We look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter.
"
