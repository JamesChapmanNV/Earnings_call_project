Person1,"Hey, <UNK>, it's <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Just to reiterate what <UNK> said earlier, you have a lot of things going on.
"
Person1,"You have new assets coming in, old assets going out.
"
Person1,"You have changes in interest assumptions in different asset areas.
"
Person1,"But the net effect is the same capital, and roughly the same net wells.
"
Person1,"Yes, we're comfortable with what we've come out with before on that, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"So the short answer is, yes.
"
Person1,"We're still very optimistic about the Avalon in that area.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That's correct.
"
Person0,"It's well productivity, is the main driver.
"
Person0,"It's about half and half in Upton and Midland County.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"Yes, the impact of that property trade for our Company was a pretty large impact.
"
Person0,"And that's the kind of thing, the kind of asset high-grading that I think we ought to continue to do.
"
Person0,"Landing them both at the same time and closing two deals on the same day, or announcing two deals on the same day, is a little bit of a trick.
"
Person0,"But in general, as we progress through the year, continuing to consolidate Tier 1 core acreage and sell off stuff that is further out in the drilling queue, is an activity that I hope we will continue to see.
"
Person0,"Yes to the first two.
"
Person0,"And the lateral length, I think those are all two-mile laterals down there.
"
Person0,"A mile-and-a-half to two miles.
"
Person0,"All right, thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, right now the north is a lot bigger than the south.
"
Person0,"We've had good results from second Bone Spring, Avalon and Wolfcamp in the north.
"
Person0,"And primarily, what we're doing in the south is Wolfcamp.
"
Person0,"So I think that will be expanding, but we're very pleased with the performance of the North Harpoon area in the southern Delaware Basin.
"
Person0,"It competes with anything we're doing in the northern Delaware.
"
Person0,"And as we've stated, we think that the efficiencies will continue to drive costs lower and production higher.
"
Person0,"We like both those areas.
"
Person0,"The Avalon oil is just as -- I mean the rates of return, the productivity, the prospectivity, is just as good as anything we have.
"
Person0,"We're really high on it.
"
Person0,"One of the big drivers was that trade, where we're doing more drilling now, more of our capital in the southern Delaware Basin around North Harpoon.
"
Person0,"That's a big driver.
"
Person0,"Yes, in our prepared remarks we said we added two rigs immediately on those acquired acres.
"
Person0,"I'd like to dispel that notion that we've been primarily a Delaware Basin player.
"
Person0,"I mean, we bought Henry Petroleum back in 2008, and they were one of the first movers in recognizing the oil potential in the Wolfcamp on the western side of the Midland Basin.
"
Person0,"So we inherited a lot of that knowledge, expertise.
"
Person0,"I think we were an early mover over there.
"
Person0,"It's just been, with all our Delaware activity and everything we're doing in New Mexico, all that really good Midland Basin stuff got lost in the bigger picture.
"
Person0,"But I think we've got some of the best Midland Basin acreage that there is.
"
Person0,"Our well results compare with anything that anybody else is turning out in the Midland Basin.
"
Person0,"And we now have completed the infrastructure kind of investment that we needed in place, so that you could run a multi-rig pad drilling development kind of program.
"
Person0,"So we're ready to devote more capital there.
"
Person0,"When we come out of this cycle and things start rolling rapidly again, I think it would be good for Concho to have multiple growth drivers.
"
Person0,"The last time we came through this growth cycle, the growth of the Company was really driven by the northern Delaware Basin.
"
Person0,"I think next time, we'll have multiple growth drivers.
"
Person0,"I think that will be a better, more diversified Company.
"
Person1,"We've got 110,000 net acres, and we like the great majority of it.
"
Person0,"Yes, is the answer to all those questions.
"
Person0,"The longer lateral length is primarily coming from the Midland Basin and the southern Delaware Basin.
"
Person0,"And that's where we just really put the rigs on.
"
Person0,"No, I hope they get better.
"
Person0,"One thing you're dealing with, with longer laterals though, is just the mechanical ability to move that much fluid out of a two-mile lateral.
"
Person0,"So I think as the industry goes to longer and longer wells, the initial 24-hour, 30-day rates aren't going to move as much as the 60- and 90-day rates.
"
Person0,"Because these wells, in the first initial days, you just can't make that much more fluid out of that sized hole.
"
Person0,"But I think they will hold up better, and you'll get better economics.
"
Person0,"Our DUC inventory is down to about -- what is it.
"
Person1,"30.
"
Person0,"30.
"
Person0,"And in general, because the conditions have changed a little bit, there's not as much tightness in the supply for frac spreads.
"
Person0,"So the balance of inventory of wells waiting on being completed and wells drilling, I don't think you need quite as many wells waiting on completion as you had in the past.
"
Person0,"There's more flexibility in the system because of excess capacity of frac spreads.
"
Person0,"It's just a basis of partners joining or not joining in the wells, and our net interest in those wells, at this point in time.
"
Person1,"Yes, so as we've said in the past, we've come down significantly from 2015 to 2016.
"
Person1,"And going from 2016 to 2017, there may be some modest shallowing in that decline curve, but not anything comparable to the change between 2015 and 2016.
"
Person1,"That's right.
"
Person1,"A more steady base, is a way to think about it.
"
Person0,"I'm sorry, could you -- try that again.
"
Person0,"I think that our long-term strategy that we've had works well in cycles like this, the way we think about our balance sheet and our leverage and our activity.
"
Person0,"And I think what's going to differentiate Concho going forward is our ability to grow within cash flow.
"
Person0,"And so when you compare us to other companies, I think our growth will be differentiated, or better, and we'll be drilling within cash flow, while others will probably be outspending their cash flow.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Yes, in general, we're experiments with everything.
"
Person0,"But specifically to your question, one thing we've done to reduce expenses -- early in the process of drilling these wells, several years ago, we would put electric sub-pumps on the wells, so we could move the fluid faster.
"
Person0,"That was very expensive.
"
Person0,"And so as we've tried to optimize things, especially at lower oil prices, we'll put mechanical pumping units on them earlier.
"
Person0,"They move less fluid, but it kind of flattens the decline curve.
"
Person0,"So it's not really choking them back, but it's controlling cost, and not using as many sub-pumps.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"The pace will slow down markedly, and we're going to stay consistent with the budget that we laid out in the beginning of the year.
"
Person1,"Yes, it's, again, consistent with the 10%.
"
Person1,"It's embedded in that 10% of non-drilling and completion capital in the budget.
"
Person1,"And I don't believe we broke it out beyond that.
"
Person1,"You bet.
"
Person0,"Good morning.
"
Person0,"Yes, I think the Permian is in better shape than the other basins, because the Permian seems to be the place right now that all the equipment wants to come to.
"
Person0,"We spoke about the rig count.
"
Person0,"The rig count is at a historic low right now, at about 130 rigs.
"
Person0,"So there's a long way to go to add back equipment and people, even to get back halfway to where we were two years ago.
"
Person0,"So I do think that, in general, it will take the industry some time to respond to increased activity.
"
Person0,"But we need some increased activity just to get back to normal.
"
Person0,"So I think we have a lot of spare capacity right now, and we're likely to have spare capacity for some time to come.
"
Person0,"All right, thank you.
"
Person0,"All right, thank you once again.
"
Person0,"I know that it was a busy morning, and I appreciate you dialing into the Concho call.
"
Person0,"It was a really good quarter.
"
Person0,"We look forward to talking to you again at the end of second quarter.
"
Person0,"And thanks again for your interest in Concho.
"
