Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"On a stick lumber, the prices you see on Random Length Lumber, I believe that most of that has already been priced into the market.
"
Person1,"With regard to treated lumber, we have not seen a significant movement in treated lumber.
"
Person1,"It's been relatively stable.
"
Person1,"The demand in the first quarter was pretty well represented across the board.
"
Person1,"The do-it-yourself channel was probably more influenced on a greater level of composite sales versus lumber sales.
"
Person1,"So we believe, based on what we see across the board, that we're seeing an expansion there.
"
Person1,"With regard to the margins, the margins were not significantly impacted by either channel growth.
"
Person2,"Or product lines either.
"
Person1,"Well, I'll give you a little bit background.
"
Person1,"Trex worked on ways to cool decks a number of years ago.
"
Person1,"And we were very successful in those tests to develop decks that could reduce the temperature of the decks.
"
Person1,"At the end of the day, our findings were they did not reduce the temperature of the decks sufficiently that it was an advantage to the consumer.
"
Person1,"We have not tested any products that reduce the temperature of a deck significantly that you would want to spend any extra money on it.
"
Person1,"Our tests with consumers has indicated, at the price we believed we'd need to charge, they were uninterested in paying that extra amount.
"
Person2,"By far, the lines here are still going to be the domestic market and is a good indicator -- gauge for this marketplace.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, the conversion from wood is something that we -- based on all of the sources we've seen, we're clearly seeing movement on.
"
Person1,"It's pretty difficult this time of year to judge share gains because, in the first quarter, most of the sales that occur in the first quarter are load-in to the distributors and into the dealers.
"
Person1,"So until you get that sell-through, you really don't know for sure what's happening with regards to taking share from other composite manufacturers.
"
Person2,"We have not seen anything on that.
"
Person2,"And I think that that's scheduled to come out later in the spring, late spring, early summer.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"So the same issues with capacity utilization and our manufacturing improvements, is it doesn't reflect the financials of the company, particularly while using that as an indicator.
"
Person2,"We did indicate last year that we were over 50%.
"
Person2,"You can see where our sales growth is.
"
Person2,"We're running at a higher level this year, but it still doesn't model the company at, whereas the incremental margin guidance, because of those additional efficiencies that we have in our operations, from a rate and yield perspective, provide a better capability to model the company.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, as you're well aware, over the years, we've put a number of processes in place that actually expand our throughput and, therefore, our capacity available.
"
Person1,"I think that level is not possible without certain expansions of certain bottlenecks.
"
Person1,"We have a number of active programs in place that would assist us in overcoming that.
"
Person1,"But the biggest problem any manufacturer has is dealing with the peak season, which, basically, is from May through July.
"
Person1,"And at that point, if you didn't have the inventory or that expanded capacity, that'd be somewhat of a bottleneck.
"
Person1,"We model that on a regular basis to make a judgment because, obviously, if you need a new plant, you've got to plan that several years in advance.
"
Person1,"And we do not have any new plans at this point for construction of a new facility.
"
Person1,"We believe our existing capacity is more than adequate to cover the next several years, at least, without any changes or improvements in our processes.
"
Person2,"We're not really seeing a change in the -- if we're addressing poly specifically, a change in the price in the marketplace, but more so of the sourcing strategy, the types of materials we're going after.
"
Person2,"We've mentioned before that we see that poly market being relatively stable from a price perspective.
"
Person2,"So now it's more on the capability of our sourcing team to be finding the right materials and becoming more efficient as we go forward.
"
Person2,"Other raw material supplies have been relatively stable as well, but what's more important are the cost-reduction initiatives that we continue to work on and the team is executing.
"
Person1,"One of the things we have seen, as you're probably aware, Trex uses recycled polyethylene.
"
Person1,"Over the last year, we have, in fact, seen a -- an increase in virgin polyethylene prices, both for linear low density, which is what we use and also high-density polyethylene.
"
Person1,"With the off-spec resin, which some people use to fill in their demand, that has been relatively stable and quite attractive, but you can't buy your whole source from that.
"
Person1,"So we do see a little bit of pressure on some of our competitors from a cost standpoint.
"
Person2,"We're very comfortable with where the channel is at this point.
"
Person2,"As Jim mentioned, first quarter is primarily a sell-in quarter.
"
Person2,"And we look at it on a year-over-year basis.
"
Person2,"We work with our distributors, understand what they have moving into the season.
"
Person2,"And we're very comfortable moving into the second quarter.
"
Person1,"Well, our distributors are focused on being able to service the market when the weather breaks.
"
Person1,"They began taking material in, in December and that was relatively undisrupted.
"
Person1,"The weather conditions we saw Northeast, you had the one snowfall that came in late that did slow the Northeast market a bit.
"
Person1,"And also, you remarked on the wet weather out West, that certainly did have a temporary impact on the California and the Pac Northwest.
"
Person1,"That seems to have picked up the shortfall by now, and that's pretty much behind us.
"
Person2,"Let me take the pricing first.
"
Person2,"We didn't take any pricing going into this year.
"
Person2,"And any new pricing, we would communicate to the channel.
"
Person2,"So that gain that you're seeing is all volume.
"
Person1,"As we talked about last year, we do have 1 competitor who is putting aberrant programs out of there that as they try and disrupt the market and gain share back, they have been essentially ineffective with that.
"
Person1,"It creates more distress by the people that they're trying to recruit than wins their hearts.
"
Person1,"So we haven't seen any fallout from that.
"
Person1,"Thank you to everyone for participating in today's call.
"
Person1,"We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences and investor meetings.
"
Person1,"Have a good weekend.
"
