Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Hello, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I -- we're in the regulatory approval process right now and the process of filing for antitrust approval and also shareholder approval.
"
Person1,"I think on this point, we've got to stick to the script that we had at the time we did the announcement.
"
Person1,"The two companies are still operating independently of each other at this point.
"
Person1,"And so, I think I'd refer you back to the slide deck that we have from the announcement in mid-September.
"
Person1,"I don't think we can go any further of that, than that, on this call this morning.
"
Person1,"I'm going to start this.
"
Person1,"And, <UNK>, if you have something to add.
"
Person1,"No, I mean, I think that the -- we had a price increase October 1.
"
Person1,"Which, we do annually at -- on October 1.
"
Person1,"And, we saw, kind of, the same activity from the channel that we normally do.
"
Person1,"So, no, I don't think I saw any material difference.
"
Person3,"No, <UNK>, I guess I'd add I think our price increase was pretty similar to the rate it's been in prior years.
"
Person3,"Generally, in that 1 point to 1.5 point- range.
"
Person3,"I think the behavior of our distributors was very similar to what it's been.
"
Person3,"There's some businesses that might have been a little longer or shorter in the context of the pre-buy.
"
Person3,"But, those tend to average out.
"
Person3,"And, so, I'd say, overall, pretty similar impact to what we've seen in the past.
"
Person1,"I don't think we quantified that in the prepared remarks.
"
Person1,"I'm going to start this, and then, <UNK>, if you want to quantify, you can.
"
Person1,"The plant got back up and running and also we got availability of the inventory that was in the facility in late September.
"
Person1,"So, we lost a good five weeks, maybe even six weeks.
"
Person1,"But, it occurred -- the explosion was, kind of, in early August.
"
Person1,"And, by the time we exited the quarter, we had full access to the facility again.
"
Person1,"I just want to make clear that, in a country like China where we import product into, and we hold it in a logistics point, we don't have the flexibility to do a rush of new products into the country.
"
Person1,"Because, they got to clear the port.
"
Person1,"So, the fact that we lost access, not only to the manufacturing, but, to the inventory to ship, is what caused this disruption.
"
Person3,"Yes, I think that the -- roughly, the difference in trajectory on that business alone had about a 60 basis point impact, approximately, on the total internal growth number.
"
Person3,"And, about 300 basis points on the rest of world.
"
Person3,"So, again, it's hard to tell.
"
Person3,"But, if we look at difference in trends, that was the -- that's the impact.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person3,"That's exactly right.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"You got it.
"
Person3,"I would add that those liabilities will likely be refinanced.
"
Person1,"Yes, correct.
"
Person1,"I mean, our intentions are to refinance these in the near term.
"
Person1,"But, they did move in the quarter from long-term to current.
"
Person1,"Morning.
"
Person3,"Morning, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Yes, on the inventory.
"
Person3,"Obviously, we don't provide guidance on a quarterly basis.
"
Person3,"But, I guess, I would say over a period of time we've brought it down gradually.
"
Person3,"I would have the expectation that it continues to come down gradually.
"
Person3,"We may have an individual quarter where it may stay stable or come up a little bit based on either transitional items, transitional initiatives we have, in the near term, relative to the margin improvement initiative.
"
Person3,"Or, quite frankly, new products, as you mentioned.
"
Person3,"But, I guess I'd take a longer term, or moderate, intermediate term view on it, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Say that, I would expect to -- we've got considerable room to continue to bring this thing down.
"
Person3,"Relative to CapEx.
"
Person3,"I'm -- at this point in time, in our CapEx expenditures, are relatively modest based on historical trends so far.
"
Person3,"I think that is an area, again, relative to our asset turns that we're focusing on.
"
Person3,"And, I guess, I would say for the year, I would anticipate it being in the $65 million to $80 million range for the year.
"
Person1,"You bet.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you very much for your interest in DENTSPLY.
"
Person1,"That concludes our conference call.
"
Person1,"I'll be around today for follow up.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
