Person0,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I guess, I'm not understanding the balance question.
"
Person1,"Yes, we're still, we're much more optimal than we were, but we still have significant opportunity to shift in that direction.
"
Person1,"And again, it's really just ensuring that we've got what the kids are looking for today.
"
Person1,"And I think as -- we'll continue to move in that direction, but certainly ensure that we still have performance-based product for the consumer that's looking for that.
"
Person1,"We're more in balance than we were, but we still have significant opportunity, primarily with regard to store growth in that category.
"
Person2,"Yes, we absolutely do.
"
Person2,"I think, what we are trying to look at -- the long-range performance of those categories over the last few seasons, has not been in line with what's happened with our footwear business.
"
Person2,"So we're trying to be conservative there, with how we're planning those businesses.
"
Person2,"But at the same time, know that if we see opportunities, we'll certainly try and capitalize on them.
"
Person2,"We do feel like we're making significant improvement in those categories, but those categories overall are a little bit pressured, and we didn't realize the gains based off the weather.
"
Person2,"There's probably -- on the merch margin or product margin side, there's probably a little more opportunity in the back half, just based on last year compares.
"
Person2,"But when you talk about total gross margin, there will be some effect on the warehouse and occupancy expenses, as we build out the DC for that fulfillment capability.
"
Person2,"So there will be some additional expense flowing into that line, probably in the back half, it may offset some of that product margin favorability.
"
Person2,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"Thank you for being on the call today.
"
Person0,"We're extremely excited about the future at Hibbett Sports.
"
Person0,"As we get some of these capabilities from omni-channel, and continue to have great customer service, we feel like we're positioned very well in the marketplace for many years to come.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
