Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"Yes, we think it's a mid-single-digit from a volume standpoint, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"And then with good pricing actions, hopefully we can push that up a little bit more.
"
Person0,"I think you are looking at low side, 2%; high side, if everything goes right, 5%.
"
Person0,"And then for us to get really big growth, something will have to happen in the macro environment.
"
Person0,"So maybe one of the smaller competitors goes out of business.
"
Person0,"Think of all the different things that could happen that might impact that.
"
Person0,"But in the normal course of business, I think that's where we'll be.
"
Person0,"When you get into ORs in the low 80s, I start getting nervous from the standpoint of how much more can you improve it.
"
Person0,"Then when people ask you how much more can you improve it, I get really nervous.
"
Person0,"So, I will go back to what I said earlier.
"
Person0,"To make this better, at this level, a lot of positive things have to happen.
"
Person0,"They happened in the second quarter.
"
Person0,"We got a little bit of relief on fuel.
"
Person0,"We had, overall, pretty good volumes.
"
Person0,"And we had the volume that we wanted, and got rid of the volume we did not want.
"
Person0,"We had our pricing in place, and it did a good job.
"
Person0,"So all of those things have to occur to really make an 83 and 82.
"
Person0,"Again, if things line up, we can do it.
"
Person0,"If they don't, we're happy with an 83.
"
Person0,"This is a <UNK> opinion, so it's worthless.
"
Person0,"But I think the inventory levels we see today are the new normal.
"
Person0,"We've had a number of months to get them down, and it simply hasn't occurred.
"
Person0,"And when you talk retail, you can't group it because there are retail outlets, stores, whatever, that are doing well.
"
Person0,"And there are others that are just dying on the vine.
"
Person0,"So it's really hard for me to lump those all together.
"
Person0,"If I followed your question, when we say -- first of all, we got the warts from the Towne acquisition behind us.
"
Person0,"That's, number one, most important.
"
Person0,"Number two, we retained the business from Towne that we wanted to.
"
Person0,"So that was a big step forward.
"
Person0,"And number three, it is now priced properly.
"
Person0,"So all of those things together worked themselves out in Q2; took us a year to get there; and they will carry forward as we go into the future.
"
Person0,"That is correct.
"
Person0,"We won't buy forwarders, I can assure you that.
"
Person0,"You never know when opportunities will come up within our operating parameters.
"
Person0,"We do have competitors.
"
Person0,"But today, as we sit here, we have nothing on the books.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
