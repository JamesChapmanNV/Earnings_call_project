Person1,"Hello, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Yes, I think what we're saying is that we are lifting guidance because of the favorability that we're seeing right now in our solid waste business.
"
Person2,"Where -- what I called out before is a 60 basis point increase in margin year-over-year due to the solid waste business.
"
Person2,"Keep in mind, also, that if you look at, kind of, our increase in guidance overall.
"
Person2,"A good portion of that increase is really due to the solid waste business and that which is primarily yield.
"
Person1,"Yes, and it's being offset by a couple of things we called out.
"
Person1,"We called out the commodities and we called out some of the headwind from the E&P.
"
Person1,"But, you're right.
"
Person1,"The core business is operating very well and as we turn around these two very small parts of our business, although, obviously volatile parts of our business, that'll all -- that'll call -- come in behind it, so.
"
Person1,"You're on the right track.
"
Person1,"Business is doing really well, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Another way of saying it, right, is if recycling hadn't cratered on us, and E&P hadn't dried up, right.
"
Person1,"Our margin's wouldn't have been up 60 basis points.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"So, that's it.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"So, we've said that approximately, what, $2.4 billion of our business is that -- again, that 30%, right.
"
Person1,"So, it is restricted to some type of index.
"
Person1,"And, we've been talking about lately, it's about $800 million of that piece, is the smaller municipal contract.
"
Person1,"Generally, residential only.
"
Person1,"Call it a five-year contract.
"
Person1,"So, that $800 million that's the first piece we've been working on to move to a new index.
"
Person1,"We've now moved $150 million of that business -- $150 million of the $800 million, to a new index.
"
Person1,"That's confirmed.
"
Person1,"I'm still working on the balance.
"
Person1,"As you would expect, logically, when we tried to change how this occurs to -- with our customers and within the market, we would start with smaller contracts.
"
Person1,"And, having good success.
"
Person1,"The remaining $1.7 billion is larger contracts and franchise agreements that tend to run a lot longer than five years and also include, oftentimes, commercial small container, large container business.
"
Person1,"So, we're up to $150 million out of the targeted $800 million.
"
Person1,"We're progressing every quarter.
"
Person1,"We don't know how far it will go.
"
Person1,"We're certainly making strong arguments, and frankly, successful arguments for it, and we'll continue to do it.
"
Person1,"Again, the overarching issue here is in these kind of public-private partnerships, they've got be mutually beneficial.
"
Person1,"It's unrealistic for our municipal partners to expect us to settle for an index that doesn't adequately cover our inflation.
"
Person1,"So, we've got to cover our inflation, net of productivity, on a consistent basis.
"
Person1,"That's reasonable.
"
Person1,"It's fair.
"
Person1,"And, that's one of the reasons we're getting it done.
"
Person1,"The fact that there is this water sewer trash index, something we can point to that's been in use now, for what, 15 years or whatever, is helping.
"
Person1,"And, so, it's too early to tell how long it's going to take and how far it's going to go.
"
Person1,"I can tell you this, we're not going to stop pushing.
"
Person1,"And, that's -- we'll update you every quarter.
"
Person1,"As we go through time.
"
Person1,"But, it's certainly helping and we'll certainly show some benefit into next year
"
Person1,"Yes, so it's fair.
"
Person1,"It's equitable.
"
Person1,"And, in some cases, it's helpful for them.
"
Person1,"Especially, those municipalities that have their own sewer and water infrastructure, that has been struggling to keep up with the pace of inflation.
"
Person1,"Frankly, we weren't the only ones that didn't know that this sewer/water, water/sewer/trash index existed.
"
Person1,"So, we're shedding a lot of light on that.
"
Person1,"And, so again, progress continues and we -- we're hopeful and confident that we'll have another positive update for you as we go through the year.
"
Person1,"Well thank you, Gabrielle.
"
Person1,"I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, their commitment, and most of all, dedication to operational excellence in creating the Republic way.
"
Person1,"Thank you for spending time with us today, everyone.
"
Person1,"Have a good evening.
"
