Person0,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning all.
"
Person0,"Welcome to Lamar's Q2 earnings call.
"
Person0,"We are pleased report a strong second quarter all the way around, particularly in the key AFFO per share metric.
"
Person0,"And as we move into the back half of 2016, we're quite comfortable with our previously issued full-year AFFO per share guidance.
"
Person0,"That guidance we affirmed, we have seen a slight softening of activity of late and are consequently guiding to low-single-digit pro forma revenue growth for Q3, a little bit below the pace of Q2.
"
Person0,"By the way, the SEC now requires us to use the term acquisition adjusted in lieu of pro forma in our releases.
"
Person0,"These terms for us are interchangeable, and I will be using them interchangeably.
"
Person0,"I'm going to turn it over to <UNK> to walk a little bit through the numbers, and then I will hit some other key metrics.
"
Person0,"<UNK>.
"
Person1,"Good morning, everybody.
"
Person1,"If you have your press release in front of you, if you look at the top, there's two sections.
"
Person1,"One is three-month results and then three-month acquisition adjusted results.
"
Person1,"That's what <UNK> was referring to just now.
"
Person1,"That used to be named three-month pro forma results.
"
Person1,"The numbers are the same.
"
Person1,"It's just again, we have retitled it as acquisition adjusted.
"
Person1,"You can see the net revenue on a pro forma basis was up 3.5% for the quarter.
"
Person1,"Consolidated expense growth, operating and corporate overhead was up 1.8%.
"
Person1,"So that translates to a nice return on the EBITDA line of 5.6%.
"
Person1,"Just to mention a couple of the second-quarter highlights.
"
Person1,"Same-unit digital revenue was up 5.1% for the quarter.
"
Person1,"You may recall that in the first quarter same-unit digital was up 3.4%, so hopefully we've got a trend going there.
"
Person1,"AFFO increased by almost $16 million or 13%.
"
Person1,"AFFO per share increased 12% for the quarter.
"
Person1,"And free cash flow was $190 million for the first six months of the year, and that's a $26 million increase over last year or a 16% increase.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I'll turn it back to you
"
Person0,"Great, thanks.
"
Person0,"Let me highlight again that digital performance.
"
Person0,"We are really pleased to see that number up 5.1%, same board same digital unit.
"
Person0,"It's just a real strong performance.
"
Person0,"We ended up the quarter with 2,510 digital units in the air.
"
Person0,"Recall that 171 of those were part of the Clear Channel acquisition.
"
Person0,"So year to date including that 171, we're up 221 digital units.
"
Person0,"For the year in terms of new builds, we've added 68 as of the first half.
"
Person0,"Again, the performance that they are turning in is exceeding our expectations right now.
"
Person0,"Very pleased with the performance of that platform.
"
Person0,"The national sales mix slipped a little bit Q2 versus Q1.
"
Person0,"In Q1, we were 81% local 19% national, that turned into 77% local 23% national in Q2.
"
Person0,"And in Q2, national was particularly strong.
"
Person0,"It was up 9% in our book.
"
Person0,"Local was up a little less than 2% at 1.9%.
"
Person0,"Strong categories, restaurants up 7%, service up 14%, real estate up 14%.
"
Person0,"Virtually every one of our top-10 verticals were strong and up, with the exception of retail which was down 1% in Q2 of 2016 versus Q2 of 2015.
"
Person0,"With that, I will open it up for questions.
"
Person0,"Jennifer.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"The nearest touch point we have of course is the auction that recently took place with the Clear Channel asset.
"
Person0,"And if you look at the multiples there on a trailing basis, I would say they approached but didn't quite meet where the public multiples are.
"
Person0,"On a forward basis, maybe a turn and a half less than our trading multiple.
"
Person0,"So it really depends on who the buyer is and what they can do with the asset.
"
Person0,"But if you look at the pricing we released back in January for those assets, on a trailing basis it was in the 12.5% range on a forward basis.
"
Person0,"For us, it's between 11% and 11.5% given how we're doing with the assets.
"
Person0,"All that information was part of our release.
"
Person0,"It really depends on the asset.
"
Person0,"But not all billboard assets or out of home assets are created equally.
"
Person0,"Number one, not all of them are REIT qualified.
"
Person0,"Number two, within the universal REIT qualified assets some are of higher quality than others.
"
Person0,"Again, it really depends on the quality of the assets and what a new operator can do with those assets.
"
Person0,"Again, as we moved into the summer as I mentioned, we saw a little bit of a softening of activity.
"
Person0,"So yes, that would've affected June a little bit.
"
Person0,"You're talking really about the law of small numbers there.
"
Person0,"But you could see in the performance of national versus local in Q2 that local softened up a tad.
"
Person0,"We expect as we finish up the year that national and local are going to come in pretty close to each other.
"
Person0,"Again, strong enough to meet our guidance.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I wouldn't go completely to the full second half.
"
Person0,"What we are seeing is just a little bit of a downdraft for Q3.
"
Person0,"It's a little early to call Q4, and we don't quite know how political is going to shape up.
"
Person0,"But yes, just a little bit softer than what we saw in Q2.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"So I think I can point to a couple of things.
"
Person0,"Most importantly it's been the strength of national digital.
"
Person0,"So in large part, that overperformance on the national book is disproportionately in the digital.
"
Person0,"They are coming in strong, and they are using it the way it's intended to be used.
"
Person0,"It's moving the needle for them.
"
Person0,"So I just feel real good about that, because we are investing heavily and that investment is going to pay off.
"
Person0,"We have also seen a little bit of acceleration in the use of our programmatic platform.
"
Person0,"I would describe it as still in its infancy.
"
Person0,"But it is accelerating each month, and that's an encouraging sign.
"
Person0,"In fact, for the first time I think in the industry's history we had a screen agnostic buy.
"
Person0,"Which means a digital dollar was dropped in to the algorithm, and we were competing head up against mobile screens without a predetermined allocation to out of home.
"
Person0,"And we got a share of the buy.
"
Person0,"So that was -- that happened in June, and it was quite something to see.
"
Person0,"Again, it's in its infancy, but we are seeing acceleration every month in the utilization of our automated platform.
"
Person0,"Yes, you are spot on there and it's primarily New York City.
"
Person0,"The entertainment buys have been a little bit soft and a little bit erratic.
"
Person0,"I don't know if it's the lineup of movies that are coming out this summer or what, but that's been a factor and it's been a category that's been a little bit, like I said, erratic for us.
"
Person0,"The other thing is political has been hard to get your arms around this year.
"
Person0,"I don't know what's creating that irregular pattern, but it appears to us that we should come in as predicted in October but September has been a tough call on what's going to happen with the political dollar.
"
Person0,"We guided to somewhere between [$100 million] to [$150 million], and it looks like we're pacing to get there with [$68 million] up in the first half.
"
Person0,"So I think it's a good guesstimate to just double what we have done.
"
Person0,"So let me start with the oil patch.
"
Person0,"From a top line pro forma point of view, our Southwest division is coming in the weakest, but still up.
"
Person0,"So second quarter the Southwest was up 0.1%.
"
Person0,"So weaker than the rest, but still in positive territory.
"
Person0,"And given what's going on in places like Oklahoma City and Midland, Texas and places like that, I'd count that as a win.
"
Person0,"The strongest region is the Western, followed by the Gulf Coast, followed by the Atlantic, the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest.
"
Person0,"We are not seeing anything that would send off alarm bells in terms of as we look across the regions.
"
Person0,"Relative strength pretty much everywhere with the exception of the oil patch, and as I mentioned, New York City had a difficult last few months given what was going on with the movie [buys].
"
Person1,"So in 2014 we did $7.5 million in political.
"
Person1,"In 2015, that fell down to $4 million.
"
Person1,"No, $7.5 million, $4 million.
"
Person1,"And this year, we have on the books about $5.2 million in political.
"
Person1,"September pacing slightly behind September of 2014.
"
Person1,"We took a good long hard look at that, and we're trying to ferret out where it's going to shake out.
"
Person1,"At the end of the day, we think we approach that 2014 number, but it's coming in in a different pattern.
"
Person1,"But, again, October looks like it's going to approach that 2014 pacing.
"
Person1,"We will see how it comes in.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Let me give you a definition of REIT qualified asset is when you put it there, did you intend for it to stay there forever.
"
Person0,"So you start with that.
"
Person0,"And in the outdoor world, that covers virtually all of our traditional inventory, bulletins and posters and our digital units.
"
Person0,"It also covers a little niche product that we have called logos.
"
Person0,"Those of the little blue signs on the side of highway right of ways, food, gas, lodging.
"
Person0,"Now, transit assets get parsed a little differently.
"
Person0,"Bus shelters are deemed REIT qualified.
"
Person0,"Bus benches are in a gray area, and wrapping buses, traditional transit advertising, is not REIT qualified.
"
Person0,"Obviously buses roll.
"
Person0,"So in a nutshell, that's how it breaks out in the out of home world.
"
Person0,"And again, the basic rule is when you put it there, did you intend for it to be there forever.
"
Person0,"Well, as we've said repeatedly, if there are high-quality REIT qualified assets out there, we are going to be interested and be active on the acquisition trail.
"
Person0,"There is another out of home REIT in Outfront.
"
Person0,"So certainly the two of us converting to a REIT has led to a nice list asset prices and asset valuation.
"
Person0,"Do I view that as a good thing.
"
Person0,"It's certainly been a good thing for our shareholders.
"
Person0,"So yes, again, if there's high-quality REIT qualified assets out there in the out of home space, we will be playing.
"
Person0,"Great, thank you, Jennifer, and thank you all for joining us on our Q2 earnings call.
"
Person0,"We look forward to visiting with you in November when we get together again and put a wrap on the year.
"
Person0,"Thank you, guys.
