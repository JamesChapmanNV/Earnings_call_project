Person,Sentence
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Second Quarter 2017 PS Business Parks Investor Call.

"
Person0,"Now I will turn the call over to <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Ed, and thank you all for joining us this morning.
"
Person1,"First, I will discuss the company's results for the quarter, along with updates on investments, then JP will provide details on operations and markets and Ed will finish by giving financial specifics.
"
Person1,"We have another outstanding quarter on nearly all metrics.
"
Person1,"We continue to see robust market fundamentals and great execution by our operations team.
"
Person1,"The company's total NOI growth was 5.3%.
"
Person1,"And despite the move-out of the 200,000 square foot industrial tenant in Northern California, Same Park occupancy is a solid 93.7%.
"
Person1,"Demand remained strong throughout the West Coast, Texas and Florida as we benefit from the infill locations of our park concentration.
"
Person1,"Unemployment improved in all of our markets, leading to healthy customer demand and expansions within our own customer base.
"
Person1,"Landlord-friendly markets help us maintain low transaction costs, which were $3.22 per square foot on leases executed during the quarter.
"
Person1,"There were no acquisitions during the second quarter as cap rates for industrial and flex product remain compressed, and assets are being sold with in-place market rents and high occupancy.
"
Person1,"We continued to search for value-add opportunity.
"
Person1,"We had one small asset sale in our Dallas market totaling $2.1 million with a $1.2 million gain.
"
Person1,"It was a non-core single-story office building in our flex and industrial portfolio.
"
Person1,"I'm happy to announce that Highgate at The Mile officially opened on June 1.
"
Person1,"As you know, I've been giving you updates on this project for 2 years.
"
Person1,"It is a 395-unit luxury mid-rise family building located in Tysons, Virginia.
"
Person1,"Leasing began in May, and our leasing success has exceeded expectations.
"
Person1,"In the first 10 weeks of operation, we've executed deals on 75 apartments or 19% of our units.
"
Person1,"Our rates are within pro forma, and I could not be happier with the initial success of this $117 million asset and our operating and development partner, Kettler.
"
Person1,"In summary, we had a great quarter and first half of the year, and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year due to our portfolio, team and strategy.
"
Person1,"Now I will turn the call over to JP.
"
Person2,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Led by an expanding U.S. economy, solid job growth, low unemployment and healthy demand from small businesses, our teams completed 2 million square feet of leasing in the second quarter with rent growth of 3.2%.
"
Person2,"I will take you through second quarter statistics by market, beginning in Washington Metro.
"
Person2,"Nothing much has changed in D.
"
Person2,"C.
"
Person2,"in the last 6 months.
"
Person2,"The private sector economy is still active but GSA and government contractors are not.
"
Person2,"Leasing economics are not favorable to landlords and the overall market occupancy in suburban D.
"
Person2,"hovers at approximately 85%.
"
Person2,"Having said that, our D.
"
Person2,"team was busy and signed 130 leases, totaling 465,000 square feet.
"
Person2,"Sequentially, Same Park occupancy in Q2 increased 20 basis points to 89.4%, aided by strong retention of 76%.
"
Person2,"In order to secure some of this renewal business, we had to reduce incoming rents to current market, and thus rents declined 9.6%.
"
Person2,"Finally, in Washington Metro, I mentioned on the last call that a large GSA user was scheduled to move out during the second quarter.
"
Person2,"At this point, it appears it will be staying through September.
"
Person2,"This tenant generates approximately $300,000 per quarter.
"
Person2,"In terms of production, the Southern California team was focused and signed 179 leases, totaling 403,000 square feet.
"
Person2,"Blended SoCal occupancy dropped 110 basis points to 94.9% as we lost one 30,000 square foot industrial customer in Los Angeles.
"
Person2,"Subsequent to quarter end, we re-leased that space with 14% rent growth.
"
Person2,"Strong demand from our core users helped us grow rents overall in Southern California by 5.1%.
"
Person2,"Moving to another strong market.
"
Person2,"In South Florida, we capitalized on strong user activity to increase occupancy 40 basis points to 98%.
"
Person2,"We completed 350,000 square feet of leases in 89 transactions with rent growth of 3%.
"
Person2,"Retention was 75%, thanks to us locking down some key renewals.
"
Person2,"In Texas, we signed 346,000 square feet in 65 transactions.
"
Person2,"Favorable economic conditions helped us grow rents in Austin over 14% and 6.3% in Dallas.
"
Person2,"In Austin, where demand and tour volume is strong, occupancy was 94.2% and with retention at 59%.
"
Person2,"Dallas occupancy was 90.3% during the quarter.
"
Person2,"In Northern California, we capitalized on strong market fundamentals.
"
Person2,"Leasing volume was 332,000 square feet, comprising 104 deals.
"
Person2,"Northern California was 94.9% occupied with 14.4% rent growth.
"
Person2,"Regarding the 200,000 square foot industrial space in San Jose we took back in April, we have completed our market-ready improvements and are actively marketing the space with good activity.
"
Person2,"Market conditions in Seattle remain very solid.
"
Person2,"And aided by limited new construction and healthy demand, we operated our real estate at 98.2% occupancy in Q2, signed 94,000 square feet and grew rents 15.7%, continuing to reach new peaks, especially in Kent Valley.
"
Person2,"Looking into the second half of 2017, I remain focused on improving occupancy in D.
"
Person2,"and Dallas, expanding our growing existing customer base and extracting favorable lease terms in our other markets.
"
Person2,"We have 2.7 million square feet, approximately 10% of our portfolio, expiring in 2017, and I can't wait to attack these opportunities.
"
Person2,"Now I'll turn the call over to Ed.
"
Person0,"Thank you, JP.
"
Person0,"FFO for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.55 per share compared to adjusted FFO of $1.36 per share in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 14%.
"
Person0,"The growth in FFO was driven by Same Park NOI, combined with lower interest expense and preferred equity distributions.
"
Person0,"Same Park NOI growth of 5.2% was driven by a 4.5% increase in revenue, tied to higher effective rents as rent spreads on executed deals increased 3.4% in the first 6 months of 2017 and 5.3% for all of 2016.
"
Person0,"Comparatively, Same Park occupancy increased modestly.
"
Person0,"Same Park operating expenses were up 2.9% due to higher property taxes, utility costs and compensation expense.
"
Person0,"For the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, the company incurred $23.4 million in total capital expenditures compared to $14.5 million in the same period of 2016.
"
Person0,"$5.6 million of the increase relates to costs incurred on the company's recent acquisition in Rockville, Maryland as we complete the repositioning of the asset and prepare space for occupancy.
"
Person0,"The balance of the increase incurred in our Same Park portfolio and was driven by transactions executed in 2017 as well as costs incurred on leases executed in late 2016.
"
Person0,"Year-to-date, Same Park transaction costs per square foot are $3.06 on executed deals, consistent with the $3.05 per square foot incurred on all transactions executed in 2016.
"
Person0,"For the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, the company's dividend payout ratio was a strong 71.9% compared to 67.2% for the same period of 2016.
"
Person0,"The company generated free cash of $21.9 million for the first 6 months of the year compared to $24.9 million in the same period of 2016.
"
Person0,"The decreases relate to the 13.3% first quarter increase in the common dividend.
"
Person0,"As <UNK> noted, our multifamily development commenced operations during the second quarter and is nearing final completion.
"
Person0,"Through July, the balance outstanding on the $75 million construction loan the company provided the joint venture is $61.9 million.
"
Person0,"We anticipate funding the balance over the next few months as the project is completed.
"
Person0,"With operation commencing, we reported an equity loss from the -- on the unconsolidated joint venture of $382,000 during the quarter.
"
Person0,"The primary driver of the loss were operating expenses incurred in connection with the commencement of leasing and property management activity.
"
Person0,"We will now open the call for questions.
"
Person0,"Nothing unusual, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Our in-place contractual rent increases are just over 2.5% on average across the portfolio.
"
Person0,"Nothing unusual.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, only on like maybe some of the new leasing and renewals that JP referenced and that are in the package by market.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, no, we haven't seen anything specifically from a regulatory standpoint.
"
Person2,"What we have seen is small businesses are confident right now.
"
Person2,"They're growing.
"
Person2,"They're expanding, maybe 2,000 or 3,000 square feet at a time, but I think they feel good about the business environment and maybe their prospects going forward.
"
Person2,"So -- but from a regulatory standpoint or any governmental involvement, no, we haven't seen anything specifically.
"
Person0,"Well, I think, <UNK>, we recognize that the balance sheet is in very good position right now.
"
Person0,"We've got no debt outstanding other than a very -- relatively small balance on the line of credit.
"
Person0,"So there's significant capacity within the balance sheet right now.
"
Person0,"That being said, for a significant transaction we would certainly consider issuing equity, but we also recognize the capacity that is in -- embedded in the balance sheet today.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, I think the modest decline from Q1 to Q2 was tied to some first quarter payroll burden cost and then a little bit higher cost in the first quarter on the LTEIP, just the way the accounting for that plan works.
"
Person0,"But again, a relatively modest change from Q1 to Q2.
"
Person0,"I would say that the Q2 number, it's roughly, all-in, about $2.4 million, is a good run rate going forward.
"
Person0,"Nothing more than kind of consist -- consistent with what's in the second quarter.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I think if you look at kind of where our secondaries are trading, the deal that we did in the fourth quarter of 2016 at 5.2% is trading today pretty much on -- at par on a strip basis.
"
Person0,"So if you look at that as an indication of where we could potentially issue preferred today at 5.20%, I would still tell you that it certainly brings into play the opportunity to redeem the 6% that were redeemable in May of this year.
"
Person0,"So certainly, I would say that, that is something that we're looking at very closely.
"
Person2,"Yes, we are actively marketing it, and the space looks great.
"
Person2,"There's very little supply available.
"
Person2,"And we have activity, but nothing that I'm ready to talk about right now.
"
Person2,"But I'm real confident in our ability to lease that space.
"
Person2,"And when we do, we'll see a nice rent pop from the outgoing customer there.
"
Person2,"So feel good about that piece of opportunity right now.
"
Person2,"Yes, it's going to be solid.
"
Person2,"I mean, to be honest, it's going to be very solid, so we'll see.
"
Person2,"I mean, we're being very selective on the credit.
"
Person2,"We're being very selective on the type of use.
"
Person2,"So we have an incredible piece of real estate that we're being very selective with.
"
Person2,"So we may be more patient and wait for the right user.
"
Person2,"As you know, the demand in the economy in Northern California is very strong.
"
Person2,"So -- and we anticipate our ability to push rent significantly.
"
Person2,"But all that comes into play with factors like credit and term and everything else.
"
Person2,"So we'll just have to wait and see, but I'm confident about the rent increase there.
"
Person2,"Yes, sure.
"
Person2,"In terms of looking forward a little bit, I don't see material change in that mark-to-market.
"
Person2,"With an occupancy rate in the general suburban market of 15 -- or sorry, 80% to 85%, there's not a lot of pricing power for landlords to be able to drive rents.
"
Person2,"And until we see that pricing power drive rent, that's when I think that mark-to-market will start to deteriorate a little bit.
"
Person2,"But we do have, as I mention consistently, the smaller spaces, especially below 5,000 square feet, there's more activity.
"
Person2,"The challenge is when you do a 30,000 square foot renewal that's coming off a 5- or 10-year lease, I mean, you have to meet the market, right.
"
Person2,"And so that's what we're having to do.
"
Person2,"And unless there's some dynamics that push the occupancy up to 90% in those suburban markets, so us and our competitors can sort of get some pricing power.
"
Person2,"We still are faced with some rent write-downs to keep that occupancy.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I think we are positive on '17 and '18.
"
Person2,"And as I mentioned earlier, especially Northern California and Seattle, very robust demand, limited supply, very low vacancy.
"
Person2,"Can we keep growing rents in the high teens, low 20s in those markets.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"Each quarter-over-quarter, no, I don't think that's sustainable forever.
"
Person2,"And it may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on a big deal we do or a renewal or something.
"
Person2,"But yes, I like the dynamics in those markets, and because of that, I like our ability to push rents.
"
Person2,"Having said that, we've pushed rents.
"
Person2,"As I think I mentioned in the last call, Northern California rent growth has been over 15% or around 15% for the last 9 quarters.
"
Person2,"So we are definitely capturing that rent growth and I expect it to continue.
"
Person2,"But again, it may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter in both Seattle and Northern California.
"
Person0,"Yes, Gene, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that really is tied to some of the costs that we are incurring in repositioning our asset in D.
"
Person0,"C.
"
Person0,"in Shady Grove -- at Shady Grove.
"
Person0,"So we spent roughly, year-to-date, about $5 million on that.
"
Person0,"We've indicated in the past that we'll spend about $10 million in repositioning and leasing that up.
"
Person0,"So I would expect that we'd incur the balance of that probably over the remainder of this year and maybe a little bit into next year.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We wouldn't expect, on a blended basis, for that number to vary widely.
"
Person0,"Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you in the future.
"
Person0,"Take care.
