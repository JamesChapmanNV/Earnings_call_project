Person2,"Well, the -- <UNK>, if you look at the margins on the new products, your point is exactly right.
"
Person2,"We were having great margins, but that was offset in this last quarter with our effort to let's get the old out of here.
"
Person2,"And so the margins got hit.
"
Person2,"At the end of the day, it hurt us, but we made a lot of progress.
"
Person2,"Now, in April, we still have some of that product.
"
Person2,"And we're going to -- but there's less of it than we've had in many, many years.
"
Person2,"And so, therefore, we are in a much better position and we'll be selling more of the new products.
"
Person1,"I think what we had said earlier is that we would expect it to be diminished by the March quarter.
"
Person1,"I think we said that a couple of quarters ago.
"
Person1,"I think with our efforts just to get in such good shape for the selling season, we still saw some pressure.
"
Person1,"The thing that gets a little tough to bake into the equation -- at least we're finding it's a little tough -- is, this is a -- it's a three-year complete revamp of our largest supplier.
"
Person1,"And we are in the first year right now.
"
Person1,"The first year is kind of coming to an end at the end of June.
"
Person1,"But then we've got a whole bunch of new models the year after that, and a whole bunch the year after that.
"
Person1,"In theory, we should start to have enough of the new stuff to offset any of the margin pressure caused by cleaning out the older stuff.
"
Person1,"I mean, that should be happening here in the near-term.
"
Person1,"Is it the June quarter.
"
Person1,"September.
"
Person1,"But it's definitely here because the margins are -- to <UNK>'s point -- are good on the new models -- really from any manufacturer.
"
Person1,"But --.
"
Person2,"And we're having great success with Scarab.
"
Person2,"Now with four different models, it's starting to really light up across the country.
"
Person2,"So we should get some help with that this quarter.
"
Person2,"We saw a little help with it last quarter, being it's not a big delivery of smaller boat type quarter.
"
Person2,"So if you take what's going on with Boston Whaler with their new products and with Scout, and with Sailfish and Sea Ray and Azimut, I mean, the stars are starting to align here.
"
Person2,"But it's not a switch -- we didn't get it all cleared out this quarter.
"
Person2,"But we sure made a big dent in it.
"
Person2,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Short answer is yes, with what we have on the ground and what's coming.
"
Person1,"What the industry experienced, <UNK>, was a real bad decline in inventory turns.
"
Person1,"And our turns need to improve even from where they are going to conclude this year.
"
Person1,"So we are improving turns, which will improve profitability, pressure product yields, higher margins, et cetera.
"
Person1,"So, yes, we feel very good about our inventory and our ability to sell and deliver boats in the season.
"
Person2,"I think for the balance of this year, you'll see more and more progress eliminating it all.
"
Person2,"But you know it's -- will it all happen this quarter.
"
Person2,"We are sure pushing to do that, but I kind of doubt it.
"
Person2,"But I'd say overall it will start to drawing a little less and less and less, and the margins will improve better and better, because that new product has a substantially higher margin than the older long-in-the-tooth product.
"
Person2,"Before <UNK> comments on it (laughter) -- I mean, obviously, this month, it would have been nice to have given some guidance because we knew we were going to focus on aged inventory and long-in-the-tooth product.
"
Person2,"And we -- but we did more than we even anticipated starting the month.
"
Person2,"But we would've probably have announced that early on, and not had the news that we got this morning about all the agencies.
"
Person2,"But, you know, our Board has discussed it.
"
Person2,"We've discussed it.
"
Person2,"And I'll let <UNK> give you his comments on it.
"
Person1,"Yes, we -- I mean, honestly, we talked about it again this morning.
"
Person1,"So, it is a topic that we are exploring.
"
Person1,"And do we go back to -- we gave guidance for a decade, and so we are considering whether we should go back.
"
Person1,"And is there enough clarity out there.
"
Person1,"Is there enough uncertainty that's been removed in the industry to start giving guidance again.
"
Person1,"And on an annual basis, it would probably be what it would be versus anything else.
"
Person1,"So it's certainly in consideration right now.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, your point is right.
"
Person1,"It's been a very quarter month-to-month, as <UNK> and I agree.
"
Person1,"And so we are discussing it as we speak.
"
Person2,"What do you think.
"
Person2,"Yes, yes.
"
Person2,"We appreciate that, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Appreciate the feedback.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"Thank you, operator.
"
Person2,"And in closing, I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support and interest in MarineMax.
"
Person2,"<UNK> and I are available today if you have any additional questions.
"
Person2,"And so, thank you for your time in the call.
