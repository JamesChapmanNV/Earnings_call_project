Person0,"Sorry, free cash flow we've been pretty consistent and we think it's going to be around the $60 million mark given that we do have a couple of years of slightly CapEx towards the higher end of our 5% range.
"
Person0,"And the outlier was 2015 and we sort of tried to highlight that there were some timing benefits associated with the bond interest.
"
Person0,"So 2015 is the outlier and $60 million is infinitely doable for us.
"
Person0,"It will jump around quarter to quarter also based on the bond payments and interest payments which are twice per year.
"
Person0,"But $60 million is what we have in our model.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"We are highlighting them.
"
Person0,"People can model them as they wish but we highlight them.
"
Person0,"The businesses we have could continue to infinity without those costs.
"
Person0,"They are one-off related to those specific acquisitions.
"
Person0,"In addition to that, they are a little bit higher this year because of the nature of two of the acquisitions that we did.
"
Person0,"So the Southeast Asian acquisition was an on-market.
"
Person0,"We bought a public company listed on the Malaysian exchange.
"
Person0,"And there is a significantly -- which has five locations, so it's a very good transaction for us, gave us a very good footprint but certainly very complex vis-a-vis other acquisitions.
"
Person0,"And so there was a lot higher cost in due diligence and also the acquisition process that we went through.
"
Person0,"The second one was a larger acquisition or a medium-size acquisition, sorry, in Bordeaux France and again that was a very complicated process.
"
Person0,"So typically the acquisition costs are not that high and I think that it helps investors by giving them that information, calling that out specifically.
"
Person0,"And you can model that however you like but I think it is valuable and we've been asked to provide that information in the past.
"
Person0,"So that's why we call it out and why it was so high this year.
"
Person0,"Yes, we do.
"
Person0,"The price was modestly positive net.
"
Person0,"So as <UNK> said most of it is volume in the main but it really wasn't a big delta either way.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"It wasn't in the press release but <UNK> did comment on it.
"
Person0,"So I'm sure he's happy to comment again.
"
Person0,"It should be but it is a higher CapEx year.
"
Person0,"So net-net I think that $60 million-plus is a good number.
"
Person0,"That's a good question.
"
Person0,"Our auditor is probably on the line sort of cringing right now.
"
Person0,"But our account was officially signed on Tuesday but we fully expect to have remediated the material weakness in FY16.
"
Person0,"On Tuesday.
"
Person0,"There was a little bit of translation risk in terms of the Mexican peso and also the Aussie dollar.
"
Person0,"But the translation risk in the quarter was still pretty modest at as you said 3% combined versus say 5% for the year.
"
Person0,"So it's $0.01 in the quarter, the translation risk which is a combination of Aussie dollar and Mexican pesos.
"
Person0,"Yes, it's all timing.
"
Person0,"I mean the work is happening in relation to our end-of-year accounts right now.
"
Person0,"So there are costs in April and May in relation to the finalizing the audit and all of those things that essentially will be booked in Q1 of FY17.
"
Person0,"So there will be, it will be a little bit higher basically the run rate in Q1.
"
Person0,"Not really.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"Sorry, I think the quantification is that we still feel pretty comfortable with the 9% SG&A for the year.
"
Person0,"It will be a little bit lumpy in specific quarters.
"
Person0,"If you think about the numbers for the quarter and the number for the year being roughly the same, so talk about the year specifically, we had a number of presses in jurisdictions that are difficult to hedge.
"
Person0,"And so the majority of that primarily relates to CapEx payments.
"
Person0,"So to the extent that we from time to time do have CapEx payments, equipment and purchases, in jurisdictions that are difficult to hedge there may be some exposure.
"
Person0,"It's unusual then to have that occur when there is a movement in the currencies.
"
Person0,"So Mexico and Argentina are examples of that and so we can't predict whether we will have those in the future.
"
Person0,"We do our best to mitigate those, but from time to time they occur but it is pretty unusual for us.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"No, not in that.
"
Person0,"In the low 3s.
