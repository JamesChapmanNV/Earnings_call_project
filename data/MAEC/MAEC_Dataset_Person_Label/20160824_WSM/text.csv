Person1,"On the cadence of the comps, <UNK>, do you want to --
"
Person2,"We usually don't comment on the cadence of the comps.
"
Person2,"But I can comment, <UNK> can comment.
"
Person2,"But on the promotional environment and what we saw that was different, at least from my perspective, from a financial perspective, if you look at many retailers, we are not alone in the situation.
"
Person2,"If you look at Q1 versus Q2, it was much more broad-based.
"
Person2,"We saw deceleration from Q1 to Q2.
"
Person2,"It was much more across categories than we've seen before.
"
Person2,"I think that's where you start to step back and say, this is something a little more than we've got the wrong product category in a particular brand.
"
Person2,"For your second question, are you talking about operating margins or are you talking about gross margins.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"As far as gross margins, there are so many moving parts in there, that's why so hard for us to answer that.
"
Person2,"Clearly, I am confident in our supply chain and inventory initiatives, both sourcing and comping the supply chain challenges we had last year.
"
Person2,"So I'm confident in that piece of it and that piece moving forward.
"
Person2,"Obviously it depends on the promotional environment.
"
Person2,"It depends on the mix of revenues that we have, how much is global.
"
Person2,"It depends on the level of revenue to determine where does occupancy play out.
"
Person2,"So I can't give you a specific answer to that.
"
Person2,"But I think the fact that we've seen Q4 to Q1 to Q2, we've seen improvement and we are seeing the success of our supply chain initiatives roll through, I feel really good about the gross margin.
"
Person2,"From an op margin perspective, really that is a revenue play.
"
Person2,"It really depends on -- obviously we said for Q3 we're going to be relatively in line with last year.
"
Person2,"So it's a Q4 conversation, one of our biggest quarters, and where the revenue lands.
"
Person2,"At the high end of our range we're flat to last year.
"
Person2,"And it's a range, so we could be different level on the revenue and different level on the op margin relative to our guidance.
"
Person2,"But it does assume that we've got continued improvement in our supply chain.
"
Person1,"Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
