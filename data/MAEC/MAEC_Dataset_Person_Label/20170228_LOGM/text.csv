Person1,"As we speak, our teams, our product teams, are in Budapest right now working on our long-term product strategy.
"
Person1,"So, that work is really underway, but really early.
"
Person1,"So I think you're going to have to wait a little bit until we are ready to provide more details about the integration of our different products.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"As <UNK> said, we are early days in the integration.
"
Person2,"We're going to have an analyst day in Q3.
"
Person2,"It's really too early for us to get into much more detail around reporting around what we used to call clouds, if you will.
"
Person2,"It's likely it looks different once we do report it, but it's too early.
"
Person2,"And that would be information that we would be ready to share at our analyst day.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Look, it's really clear that integration is job one, and synergy capture is closely linked to that.
"
Person1,"As I said earlier, those two things are well underway and they will continue throughout the year.
"
Person1,"The product strategy is we are now kind of turning our attention now with 30 days into the close now we've got a lot of that work, the integration work, kicked off, really digging in on the product strategy.
"
Person1,"We don't need to be disruptive and generate any kind of disruptive customer experience, so that is something we are being cautious of as we develop these product strategies.
"
Person1,"But that is something we'll start providing more detail as we work through the year.
"
Person1,"I think that's something to look for, as well as a longer-term financial model.
"
Person1,"Our hope is, on our analyst day, we're going to be talking about a three to five-year plan that we'll be prepared to share that's in line with and supporting the things that we've already been talking about in terms of long-term financial profile.
"
Person1,"But look, I think, right now, our focus is on synergy and integration, delivering on those things, and then the product component of our strategy will be shared as we work through the year.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think it's fair to say a little bit will be a little bit more frontloaded.
"
Person1,"That work is, as I said, it's underway, and we I think started very strong in February making some -- moving quickly.
"
Person1,"We wanted to get a lot of the hard work underway and behind us so we can start focusing on long-term growth.
"
Person1,"And I think that's representative of where we are.
"
Person1,"<UNK>.
"
Person2,"Yes, and I think, as <UNK> mentioned earlier, I think a good spot to also keep your eye is on our EBITDA results.
"
Person2,"And particularly we gave EBITDA guidance, adjusted EBITDA guidance, at the high end of the range at 35% today.
"
Person2,"So I think that's another good way to track our progress going forward.
"
Person1,"Thanks for the question.
"
Person1,"That's been part of the integration.
"
Person1,"I think a lot of that work is now behind us.
"
Person1,"We were -- we had planned and we executed a reorganization kind of within the first two weeks after we completed the merger.
"
Person1,"We wanted -- my goal was to get people really aligned and the people who were here and the people going forward and working as one team, and I think we are there.
"
Person1,"So I think we've had good employee retention.
"
Person1,"I think the employee base -- I know the employee base is really excited about being one company.
"
Person1,"And I've spent a lot of time with the employees from the former GoTo business as well as the LogMeIn business, but I can tell you that everyone is really excited, and now, with all that work behind us, now can focus on the go-forward business.
"
Person1,"Thank you for your questions tonight.
"
Person1,"LogMeIn finished 2016 on a high note, and with the merger now closed, we believe we have the opportunity to create a unique SaaS profile.
"
Person1,"Our focus in 2017 will be making the integration a success and laying the foundation for a company that, over the long term, is targeting 10% compounded annual revenue growth, 40% adjusted EBITDA margins, and 30% cash flow, all while returning up to $700 million to our shareholders.
"
Person1,"And we have a lot of work in front of us, but we are executing well, and it's an incredibly exciting time in our history.
"
Person1,"We look forward to sharing our progress when we report our Q1 results in April.
"
Person1,"Thanks again for taking the time this evening.
