Person2,"I'll let <UNK> take virtual reality and I'll come back to you on the share repurchase.
"
Person1,"Virtual reality is a very exciting technology.
"
Person1,"I bet you all have seen that we were the exclusive place where you could try the Oculus in our stores.
"
Person1,"So a lot of excitement there.
"
Person1,"The impact on the business this year is going to be very marginal.
"
Person1,"So I think exciting from a consumer and PR standpoint, very small, at this point, from a revenue standpoint.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, on the buyback, why didn't we buy more shares in the first quarter.
"
Person2,"It really is the way our pattern has been since we've been buying shares back.
"
Person2,"Remember that we, because of year-end earnings releases, there's that period in the middle of the first quarter where we are of out of the market until we get our information out there.
"
Person2,"So we're always going to be a little bit lower probably in the first quarter.
"
Person2,"You guys can probably expect that, because that will always probably be the case.
"
Person2,"And then of course, we are absolutely committed to our $1 billion repurchase over the next couple of years.
"
Person2,"So we are all-in on that.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, thank you so much for your comments.
"
Person1,"This will go to the heart of all of our Blue Shirts, the fact that we're telling them that we're seeing it is great.
"
Person1,"The fact that you're seeing it is just terrific.
"
Person1,"And I want to publicly again recognize their work.
"
Person1,"The work on developing the engagement and proficiency in the stores has been a key area of focus for us, and I have to give credit where credit is due to Shari Ballard and her team across the country in driving that.
"
Person1,"What is the form that it takes, is your question.
"
Person1,"It's a number of things.
"
Person1,"The most impressive thing is at the individual level.
"
Person1,"The philosophy is that the performance of Best Buy is really the sum of the individual performance of each individual associate.
"
Person1,"The way you lift the performance of Best Buy is by getting more of the associates to be very proficient, very engaged and to achieve their individual sales targets.
"
Person1,"As you know, we're not commissioned, but we're driving performance.
"
Person1,"The form it takes in the stores is through daily coaching.
"
Person1,"Every morning when you check in as an associate, you spend time with your supervisor looking at the results and getting a one-on-one.
"
Person1,"And it's absolutely you world class, coaching about how you can get better at your job.
"
Person1,"The individual associate looking at the performance will look at whatever things that can get better.
"
Person1,"They may get some ideas from their manager and then check ins during the day and then check in at the end of the day.
"
Person1,"It's a systematic approach.
"
Person1,"Now on top of that, we're increasingly focused on lifting the product knowledge.
"
Person1,"Because proficiency is selling skills and product knowledge.
"
Person1,"We're moving to certify the associates and raising the bar if terms of what's expected.
"
Person1,"All of the executive team at Best Buy is certified to sell 4K TV and high end networking equipment, showing that it's part of the job.
"
Person1,"If the bosses cannot do the job, then it's not a good company.
"
Person1,"So there is -- and of course, it goes to all of the associates.
"
Person1,"So it's really beautiful to see.
"
Person1,"We believe there is a lot more room to drive performance on that basis.
"
Person1,"We look at, with Shari, the percentage, and her team, we look at the percentage of associates who are achieving the individual sales targets.
"
Person1,"We see a lot of room for improvement, and that's a continued focus.
"
Person1,"So the way it manifests itself is that a store gets the traffic it gets.
"
Person1,"That's not within essentially the control of the store, but they're focused on what we call value-add, which is the difference between the traffic and then the comp stores in the stores.
"
Person1,"And with a given traffic, you can get different results.
"
Person1,"And so with the same amount of payroll, you can get different results.
"
Person1,"So we think that this is another gift that will keep giving and truly a remarkable set of accomplishments so far.
"
Person1,"So Shari, congratulations for your work.
"
Person1,"But beyond Shari, well done to the entire Best Buy team across the stores.
"
Person1,"Couldn't be more proud.
"
Person1,"So I need to conclude the call.
"
Person1,"I want to thank all of you for joining us today.
"
Person1,"Again, a very strong quarter.
"
Person1,"Again, want to congratulate all of our teams.
"
Person1,"We are, as you can see, we're very excited to have the opportunity to continue to work on our key priorities and with the opportunities that I related to that.
"
Person1,"I want to join everybody, of course, on the call in congratulating <UNK> and Corie.
"
Person1,"I know Corie is very much looking forward to meeting all of you and working with all of you.
"
Person1,"I know <UNK> is very much looking forward to introducing.
"
Person1,"As a reminder, <UNK> is not going away.
"
Person1,"She's going to be here until the end of the year in an advisory role.
"
Person1,"She'll introduce Corie to each of the investors and analysts and work with Corie to make this an incredibly seamless transition.
"
Person1,"It's going to be one of <UNK>'s legacies to have successfully on-boarded -- chosen and on-boarded and groomed and on-boarded Corie.
"
Person1,"So very exciting time ahead.
"
Person1,"Thank you so much for your attention.
"
Person1,"You all have a great day.
"
Person2,"Bye, guys.
"
