Person2,"Not -- it's not that easy of math unfortunately.
"
Person2,"So we can walk you through it, <UNK>, if you want to give us a call.
"
Person1,"And that's 60% capital investment to 30% capital investment.
"
Person1,"That is the equity part.
"
Person1,"Hi, Mike.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"There were a lot of points in that roll-forward there.
"
Person2,"Let me just step back and try to walk you through it.
"
Person2,"So there was about 1.4 million shares listed net impact.
"
Person2,"Are you asking for the total number of options that were initially exercised.
"
Person2,"Is that what you're asking for.
"
Person1,"So that was -- so if you -- I mean, I know I'm going to give you very round numbers.
"
Person1,"Generally --
"
Person1,"It was about half.
"
Person1,"So if there was a net negative impact of 1.4 million shares on our diluted share count as a result of the cash portion that was gone to taxes, that means that we retained roughly 1.4 million shares.
"
Person1,"So that would mean the net -- the net value because it's just a profit part of the options was 2.8 million shares among everybody, although half of that was settlement cash which was paid in taxes.
"
Person1,"Is that your question.
"
Person1,"That's right.
"
Person1,"The way the diluted share count works is they calculate the number of shares of stock that would have to be given to settle the profit portion.
"
Person1,"So if you have an option at $20 and stock is at $30, they figure out how many options it takes to settle the $10 spread, the profit spread.
"
Person1,"And that's what is in our diluted share count.
"
Person1,"That portion -- that profit portion, because I know that taxes were around 50% and that was roughly 1.4 million shares, generally that portion was 2.8 million shares of which half was settled in cash of -- and because half was settled in cash, it lowered the diluted share count.
"
Person1,"I can tell you on the other side of that we have retained the options.
"
Person1,"There isn't any change there.
"
Person1,"We've retained the stock.
"
Person1,"So you take that other half and then if you go to the ATM and you issue the 1.4 million, you get yourself back to even.
"
Person1,"Is that your question.
"
Person1,"It was roughly 1.
"
Person1,"-- it's about half.
"
Person1,"I can't -- I feel like the taxes were 51% or 49% or something like that.
"
Person1,"It was about half.
"
Person1,"So it's about 1.4 million shares.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Ordinary income.
"
Person1,"It's the ordinary income rates, state and Federal, just like your paycheck.
"
Person1,"All right.
"
Person1,"We're glad to have spoken with you today, and we look forward to speaking with you all again in one quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
