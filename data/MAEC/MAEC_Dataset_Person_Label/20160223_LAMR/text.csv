Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"I think probably the most instructive thing is to look back and see how the original auctions progressed.
"
Person0,"And it was very interesting.
"
Person0,"As you know, they had a menu of markets and an expressed desire to sell them and price them individually and not necessarily in a package.
"
Person0,"And I think they did a good job of running that process.
"
Person0,"We've managed to hone in on the markets that made the most sense for us.
"
Person0,"And I think we got them at a fair price.
"
Person0,"I would note that the markets we were either outbid on or did not bid on went for a higher multiple, if that tells you anything.
"
Person0,"You can look at certain filings and see that the multiple for the markets that -- the trailing multiple for markets we didn't get was north of 13.5%.
"
Person0,"And of course we were 12.5% -- trailing 11.5% forward.
"
Person0,"So that's fairly instructive.
"
Person0,"There were good operators out there bidding.
"
Person0,"A small venture backed group that does a really good job got Fort Smith and Wichita.
"
Person0,"I wish them well.
"
Person0,"Fairway, I believe, prevailed in the market.
"
Person0,"And some investors who are longtime outdoor folks, that I'm glad to see are getting back in, prevailed in Portland.
"
Person0,"So as I look back on that auction, I'm happy with valuation.
"
Person0,"The industry is strong.
"
Person0,"It has good independent operators, good financial backing.
"
Person0,"And just -- I think Clear Channel can be pleased on how that process ultimately concluded, and we are as well.
"
Person0,"Looking forward, we have constantly said since we became a REIT that we want to operate in a leverage band of 3 to 4 X EBITDA to total debt.
"
Person0,"We are up on 3.8% side of that, which would indicate we have a little bit of powder left.
"
Person0,"But we also generate so much free cash flow, it wouldn't be a bad idea to whittle that down to 3.5% and have even more powder left towards the back end of the year.
"
Person0,"So we'll see how the year progresses.
"
Person0,"We're very happy with what we have.
"
Person0,"We're very happy with, again, industry valuations and industry players.
"
Person0,"So all good on that front.
"
Person0,"Well, thank you all and thank you for your interest.
"
Person0,"I look forward to visiting when we report our first quarter for 2016.
"
Person0,"For those of you on the West Coast, next week I'll be at the Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco, presenting on Tuesday.
"
Person0,"Thank you all.
