Person,Sentence
Person2,"Yes, <UNK> that is a great question.
"
Person2,"I think there are a lot of unknowns here clearly.
"
Person2,"It is all blinded, so we are speculating.
"
Person2,"We don't know variability, we don't know the effect sizes, et cetera, et cetera.
"
Person2,"However, as a sort of gestalt, if you will allow me that, I think what it takes, our back of the envelope calculations take it from somewhere, the range of 50% to 85%, I think we now look at something in the range of 65% to 95%, that is a sort of slide if you like on the power.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"So if I start at the bottom at 50%.
"
Person2,"The extremes are obviously 50% power, with the incremental number of patients, the 50% moves to a 65% number.
"
Person2,"And if we were at the 85% point at this point, because we clearly don't know where we are, that 85% would move to a 95%.
"
Person2,"So we are somewhere between 65% and 95%, so the midpoint of that would be, I am doing math in my head here, about 80% power.
"
Person2,"What it is assuming I think are the assumptions are things stay relatively stable from the point of the midpoint conditional power analysis.
"
Person2,"But once again, a huge caveat here.
"
Person2,"We are dealing with a massive range of uncertainties.
"
Person2,"We don't know, all we have is an outcome from an independent group, who said, up the sample size by 200 based on a preset criteria, if that helps.
"
Person2,"It is very interesting.
"
Person2,"I can't sort of aggregate that information.
"
Person2,"I think a couple of public caveats at this point.
"
Person2,"We know that there is huge variability across these types of pain studies.
"
Person2,"One that I was certainly involved in several years back where we did an interim on one of the studies and not on the other one.
"
Person2,"At the end of the study we had very strong results, but the stronger result came in the study which had the interim analysis.
"
Person2,"They both had interim analysis.
"
Person2,"One of them increased sample size, that was the one with the stronger results at the end of the study.
"
Person2,"That obviously doesn't mean that will necessarily be the case here.
"
Person2,"I think what we have done here is slightly different, because we didn't want to take, we wanted to avoid taking an alpha hit.
"
Person2,"And we wanted to avoid unblinding in any way, shape, or form.
"
Person2,"So we had to preset numbers that made a lot of sense to us, which was that 50% to 85% range, if you like.
"
Person2,"They both had interims.
"
Person2,"The one that was increased was actually the opioid experienced.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Thank you all for joining us this afternoon.
"
Person1,"Again, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to the Company.
"
Person1,"I think we made some excellent progress, and we have an awful lot to look forward to this year.
"
Person1,"So I am very enthusiastic about it, and we look to seeing all of you at the upcoming conferences throughout the spring.
"
Person1,"Thank you, have a great evening.
