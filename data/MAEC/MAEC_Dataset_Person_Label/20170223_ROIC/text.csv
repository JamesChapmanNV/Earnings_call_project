Person0,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We are currently working on a series of transactions and have been working on that.
"
Person0,"In my humble opinion will come to fruition this year where we will be issuing a lot more equity with these families, certainly not lower than we issued equity to the public markets.
"
Person0,"I think you will see more of that in terms of our pipeline, because there are things we started working on years ago that have come -- are getting closer to the finish line.
"
Person0,"In terms of the families themselves, I don't really see yet any sort of acceleration one way or another because I think there's still some uncertainty out there in terms of tax reform and other things that could impact their decisions.
"
Person0,"The good news is our pipeline is very active in terms of working with these families, but I can't tell you that it's made any difference in terms of what we see from a more external perspective.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"No, they shouldn't vary.
"
Person1,"We typically budget kind of a flat 1.5% of revenues as far as our bad debt first pass, and then we do specific tenant review each quarter.
"
Person1,"So there's no difference in the guidance on that assumption.
"
Person1,"That's kind of the way it's looking right now as far as what we see in the pipeline in the immediate future.
"
Person1,"Our model, the way it works is it backs you into an equity need.
"
Person1,"It doesn't appear that there's a lot beyond what we're seeing in the OP side.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"In closing we'd like to thank again all of you for joining us today.
"
Person0,"We really appreciate your interest in ROIC.
"
Person0,"If you have any additional questions, please contact Mike <UNK> or me directly.
"
Person0,"Also you can find additional information on the Company's quarterly supplemental package, which is posted on our website.
"
Person0,"Thanks again, and have a great day everyone.
