Person,Sentence
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I don't think that there's -- I don't recall any data on that.
"
Person2,"But certainly, you can look at the number of rigs that they're drilling with and give you a comparison to countries like Kuwait.
"
Person1,"It's significantly larger.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Thanks for the question.
"
Person2,"The big packages have been opened.
"
Person2,"Hence, our indications.
"
Person2,"But -- so we do expect to win an award.
"
Person2,"There are multiple lots.
"
Person2,"The sizable lots, the first 3 lots, the winners of those can only win a single lot.
"
Person2,"So the process is still playing out.
"
Person2,"We expect to win, although, there are still, obviously, no guarantees as the process plays out.
"
Person1,"And I would just add to that.
"
Person1,"Again, going back to the commentary in the press release, the big change is that under the previous tender, we had 2 lots, lot 1 and lot 3.
"
Person1,"And the approach that they followed here for the procurement process has limited the major service providers to a single lot.
"
Person4,"Yes.
"
Person4,"<UNK>, it's <UNK>.
"
Person4,"Look, I think it kind of piggybacks off Parveen's earlier question on our penetration into the T&D markets.
"
Person4,"I think that's a particular region where there's substantial opportunity, and we're looking to continue to leverage new customer relationships and projects that are on in that area to grow share.
"
Person1,"And certainly as it relates to whether, when it's -- wet weather and rain that certainly helps the rental revenues.
"
Person1,"So we'd see that as some uplift.
"
Person4,"I don't think it's -- it could be limited.
"
Person4,"I think the projects are propping up growth throughout the network based on what we're seeing at this point, <UNK>.
"
Person5,"I'd actually like to continue the Sonatrach discussion, if we may.
"
Person5,"Would you help us understand what their logic was for only awarding 1 lot.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"It's really hard to say how -- why they'd go in the direction.
"
Person1,"I mean, it's not unusual for NOCs to change their bidding practices as they go forward in time.
"
Person1,"So I -- we just see this as a standard change that they're going through.
"
Person5,"And then secondarily, on the last call, it felt like you were being a bit cautious on the Gulf of Mexico opportunity simply due to the lower level of activity, and this quarter, it seems as though maybe you're feeling a bit more favorable.
"
Person5,"Is that due to market share gains and further anticipated gains.
"
Person5,"Or are we simply misinterpreting your view.
"
Person1,"Well, the award of this first well with this major IOC really is good news.
"
Person1,"And the duration and rigor of the testing over the last 18 months that they've put our fluids through has been significant.
"
Person1,"But it now serves us very well.
"
Person1,"Both the fluid and operations have -- as a result, their credibility has increased in the eyes of other operators.
"
Person1,"And so yes, you're sensing an increased sense of optimism.
"
Person5,"And this particular well that you're -- or this rig that you are on, what is the duration of the program that, that rig is anticipated to complete.
"
Person3,"We said in the script that we expect the well to be finished within the quarter.
"
Person3,"But it's a deepwater well and there's uncertainties around such operation.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I mean, the rig is deployed to this IOC.
"
Person1,"I don't know what the length of the contract is.
"
Person1,"I don't think it's a short-term contract.
"
Person1,"But again, as I mentioned that -- we've got the 1 well.
"
Person1,"If done successfully, we believe that there will be a second well behind that.
"
Person5,"Put well.
"
Person5,"And the reason I was posing the question as I did is if understand correctly that -- there are some real switching costs if -- to take you off of the rig.
"
Person5,"So if you do a good job that as long as that rig is running, you are likely going to stay on the rig.
"
Person5,"Is that a correct interpretation.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Yes, within reason.
"
Person2,"And so it's great that this IOC has switched to us and that we're taking off this well with them.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I mean, it certainly doing a good job is what we do everywhere we operate.
"
Person1,"But again, with our new Kronos technology, we think there's some really unique value in terms of the low ECD.
"
Person1,"So we'll do an outstanding job servicing the account, and we're hoping that the customer really sees the value of the new technology and wants to continue to run with it and expand.
"
Person5,"Actually, <UNK>, for those of us who are neophytes, would you please share with us what those advantages are.
"
Person1,"The key there is the low, what I'd call, ECD, or equivalent circulating density, right.
"
Person1,"So those are the big things, especially with the new regulatory climate in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
"
Person1,"And so that's the key.
"
Person1,"Do you want to add some comments, Phil.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"So it limits pressure surges down hole when you're drilling in very tight, narrow pressure windows.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"Thank you once again for joining us on the call and for your interest in Newpark.
"
Person1,"And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
"
