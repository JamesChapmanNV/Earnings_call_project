Person1,"I would say the big change for us was the further step-down in oil and gas demand.
"
Person1,"That was -- it dropped further than we had thought as we went into the quarter.
"
Person1,"That was probably the single biggest change, power gen being right there with it.
"
Person1,"So my first comment on that would be, from my experience in selling in this space, is that it's probably too soon to call the heating season.
"
Person1,"Usually, I start thinking about it when we get to Memorial Day.
"
Person1,"The cooling -- I'm sorry, the cooling season.
"
Person1,"So -- but we're seeing -- in the climate space, we're seeing normal sequential build that we -- seasonal build we'd see at this time of the year.
"
Person1,"That's doing what we would normally see it do, in terms of our sales.
"
Person1,"So we'll see an improvement in our revenues, as a result of the seasonal build.
"
Person1,"In the commercial and industrial, ex oil and gas and ex power gen, I'd say the order rates have stabilized.
"
Person1,"So -- and we do expect to see, as we enter into the back half of the year, a slight improvement as a result of destocking.
"
Person1,"<UNK> mentioned that there would -- from the programs that we're executing on right now, there was going to be a roughly $13 million benefit on an annual basis.
"
Person1,"And we believe that will start to kick in the second half of the year.
"
Person1,"So <UNK>, our business sells into natural gas water heaters.
"
Person1,"We do not sell into the electric gas water heater space.
"
Person1,"So if I'm not mistaken, I believe the natural gas water heater business in the first quarter was down in the mid-single-digits number.
"
Person1,"So we were affected by the decline in the demand.
"
Person1,"So we sell primarily into infrastructure and industrial type markets in China, and so that business was down for us.
"
Person1,"And I'd say, again, it had been down in the past.
"
Person1,"So when we sized our total industrial exposure between the US and China, I think we sized it at $40 million across the Company.
"
Person1,"And certainly, China was a sizable chunk of that.
"
Person1,"Yes, I would say it's the same scenario.
"
Person1,"We have customers, with their revenues are down rather substantially, so they're adjusting their inventories, as well.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Yes, it certainly had somewhat of an impact, as it usually does in the first quarter, with lower production.
"
Person2,"But we have all of that baked into our guidance.
"
Person2,"The slowing of production, as we work down inventory, is somewhat offset, too, by the benefits of our simplification projects and our cost savings projects.
"
Person2,"But all of that is in our guidance for the year.
"
Person2,"I'll give you all the data by segment here in a second.
"
Person2,"But I would say that we did -- when you take into consideration everything we mentioned relative to oil and gas, and excluding the oil and gas, you can see that we offset a substantial amount of decremental through the existing simplification programs and if -- so there was certainly some positive news there, relative to our execution and our ability to offset those decrementals.
"
Person2,"So if you think about the climate business, you ought to think about 25% to 30% decrementals.
"
Person2,"If you think about the C&I business, you ought to think about 30% to 35% decrementals.
"
Person2,"And if you think about PTS, you ought to think about 35% to 40% decrementals.
