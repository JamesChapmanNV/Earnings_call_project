Person0,"Good question and it hasn't come up yet, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I think it's just a mixture -- we are using a very opportunistic allocated capital approach, so we are really not focusing on particular lines of business, and so we are just looking at them account-by-account trying to make sure that we understand each one both quantitatively and qualitatively.
"
Person0,"And since we are, I think, in a pretty good position as a startup, we can be very selective, but it is not driven by any particular line or coverage type.
"
Person0,"Yes, I don't really have a precise number.
"
Person0,"It was a good mix, in that 50/50 range give or take, but I don't think you should read anything into that in terms of run rate or anything as we do look at it opportunistically.
"
Person1,"No, I think that issue is a little bit separate, so, again, it's just looking at the reserves following a consistent process and looking at it from a quarter-to-quarter basis.
"
Person1,"So that was a little bit different.
"
Person1,"Following the normal process, but mostly case in the D&O.
"
Person1,"Certainly there was nothing -- again, nothing that was special that was in there following our normal process.
"
Person1,"I would say that it was spread over -- actually that one was spread over some pretty evenly accident years.
"
Person1,"So you are looking at 2015, 2014, 2013 about $4 million for really each one of those and $4 million per year and then it was $3 million for accident year 2013 and prior.
"
Person1,"So it was really just following our standard process and again, it's kind of tough.
"
Person1,"As we are growing it, it's still I will say young, but you've got a lot of new policies coming in and we are just being conservative in the way we set our picks there.
"
Person0,"In terms of our share count, it's about 166 million, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"166 million.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>; and thank you so much for your comments regarding us.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"It means a lot.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Jessa.
"
Person0,"Before we end, I did want to correct one set of numbers that I gave in answer to Paul <UNK>'s question.
"
Person0,"I picked up the wrong line and in terms, Paul, of the auto current accident year combined, or loss ratios before catastrophes, it's 79.1 for the current quarter, 81.6 same quarter a year ago, but my comments reflected the auto.
"
Person0,"And with that, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today.
"
Person0,"We hope to see some of you at our annual shareholders meeting Saturday at the Cincinnati Art Museum.
"
Person0,"Others are welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting.
"
Person0,"It's available at cinfin.com/investors and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second-quarter call.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
