Person,Sentence
Person0,"Of course, within there, you've got DMI and the growth that we're starting to see there come back.
"
Person0,"So what changed to get it higher is we've been working on this.
"
Person0,"We acknowledge that it's been a little bit frustrating a couple of quarters where we had some operational hiccups.
"
Person0,"We think it was more us.
"
Person0,"There's still a very strong, very solid long-term demand, obviously, for physicians and for veterinarians.
"
Person0,"Globally, by the way, but obviously here, we're focused on United States and Canada, for the most part.
"
Person0,"But, increasingly, we see global opportunity.
"
Person0,"And I think it was a combination of some reorganization to better support the medical schools, in particular.
"
Person0,"That's what more of the issue was.
"
Person0,"The vet school was pretty steady through that little hiccup that we had.
"
Person0,"And also, we have very strong brand reputations and we saw a real opportunity to do a better job of communicating, of taking some things that were working for a long time -- I think I mentioned the information seminars.
"
Person0,"That's been a tried-and-true part of the DMI recruiting process for a long time.
"
Person0,"But we were still doing it the same way we've always been doing it, yet the environment was changing around us, more social, more digital, not just radio.
"
Person0,"Radio is still there, but you've got to supplement that, and you've got to follow up with different technologies in different ways.
"
Person0,"So by doing that, we've improved the results.
"
Person0,"And of course, that goes hand-in-hand with the academic results, because students see those residency match rates.
"
Person0,"That has been very important for us.
"
Person0,"And all of that was what was behind the May number of 11%.
"
Person0,"We don't expect to see that as a long-term trend, because 11% is a little bit of a catch up for making up for lost time.
"
Person0,"But we think we can still -- we're in good shape here for September, and long-term, see continued low single digit enrollment growth over the long-term.
"
Person0,"No.
"
Person0,"I'm saying we're still catching up for lost time here, so it could be better.
"
Person0,"We're feeling good about September.
"
Person0,"I'm just saying, from a long-term -- I get back to that five-year long-term average -- we think that's the more prudent way to forecast, and if we do a little bit better sometime than long-term trend, great.
"
Person0,"I just wouldn't want to say that double-digit is a long-term trend.
"
Person0,"There's a little bit more at AUC.
"
Person0,"You want to comment on that, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That's good.
"
Person0,"We do see increasing international opportunity, as well, for international students.
"
Person0,"Most of our history has been US and Canada.
"
Person0,"But we've had more and more interest from international students coming through the schools.
"
Person0,"And I think that would probably show up a little bit more at AUC than at Ross, on the margin.
"
Person0,"But also, at the vet school, I should hasten to add there, a lot of international interest in our vet program.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
