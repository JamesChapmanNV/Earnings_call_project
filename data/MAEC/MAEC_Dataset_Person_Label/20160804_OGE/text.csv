Person1,"It's really just the downturn in commodity prices and just operating results from Enable for the most part.
"
Person1,"It's really a change in the tax law in Louisiana and its taxes that flow through from Enable.
"
Person1,"If you recall, back in 2013, we setup an employment company and we booked -- we increased what we booked, a deferred tax liability of about $17 million and this really just brings that down and it's just a change that they made in their apportionment calculation.
"
Person1,"Yes, until some other change would be made in the tax code, but yes, one-time.
"
Person1,"July weather was slightly above normal, it was pretty humid.
"
Person1,"So yes, it helped us get back on track.
"
Person1,"If you recall from the first quarter, we were down a little more on weather and we made up some of that or we will make up more of that in July, it was pretty good.
"
Person0,"Yes, I think that's accurate.
"
Person0,"No, I think we look at those independent and so that's not going to factor into that.
"
Person0,"My comments around the CapEx were really focused on what value we could bring to those communities and those customers.
"
Person0,"I want to see that customer benefit and then I want to make sure that we have clear line of sight of how we're going to recover that.
"
Person0,"And that's how we think about that piece of the business and again Enable is a separate discussion and as we've talked about, we like the way this is working where they're actually flowing cash to us.
"
Person1,"The Ad Valorem is really property taxes.
"
Person1,"That's just what they call it in Oklahoma.
"
Person1,"So we just added that.
"
Person1,"If you recall, when we were in the rate case, we were looking for [Seawip].
"
Person1,"We're just adding in the AFUDC and the property taxes now given how we'll be recovering that going forward.
"
Person1,"We get both.
"
Person1,"We get a return on and we anticipate we'll get recovery as well.
"
Person1,"We just haven't included that in our CapEx up to this point.
"
Person1,"That's correct.
"
Person0,"Sure, thanks <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I think your description, we are utility, we've got that and we've actually removed a lot of that commodity exposure.
"
Person0,"Recall, we used to have 25% of our business was Enogex.
"
Person0,"Now, it's a much smaller piece, but we positioned Enogex not for earnings, but for cash -- I mean Enable, not for earnings, but for cash.
"
Person0,"And that's how we're thinking about Enable.
"
Person0,"So OGE is a utility.
"
Person0,"It just has a cash flow stream coming out of Enable.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"So, generally speaking, they are ROFO and ROFR rights, okay, and it's for any of the pieces, meaning the GP or the LP individually or combined for both.
"
Person0,"That's just how it works.
"
Person0,"Yes, we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
"
Person0,"I'm not exactly sure how we're going to handle all that as far as what ultimate decision we make, but obviously we'll address that in some way.
"
Person0,"Yes, so let me -- <UNK>, the first question I think to be perfectly honest, you need to address that with CenterPoint.
"
Person0,"I mean their decision criteria is something that they ought to speak to, but as far as the way this works is on August 17.
"
Person0,"That is the date when the 30 days is up.
"
Person0,"If we make an offer for any or a piece of this or whatever it is, CenterPoint will have 30 days to respond.
"
Person0,"If it's not accepted, they will have 120 days to sell that interest for a value not less than 105% of what we offered.
"
Person0,"Then again, if we don't make an offer, that's a different issue.
"
Person0,"They have 120 days to go pursue their transactions.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Yes, the [ROFR] provisions, they work kind of mirror of each other.
"
Person1,"So, if they were to receive an unsolicited offer, we have a [ROFR] right on that as well.
"
Person1,"Right.
"
Person1,"Yes, what we're really doing is we're deferring recording any income off of that.
"
Person1,"So we're effectively setting up a regulatory liability.
"
Person1,"We are receiving the cash, but we will wait until an order before we book any earnings associated with that.
"
Person1,"Yes, they did.
"
Person1,"No, we've exhausted those outcomes and we have the compliance deadline of January of 2019 and unfortunately we have to meet those deadlines.
"
Person1,"No, I do not believe there was.
"
Person1,"Yes, Enable's hedges are really for the balance of 2016 and they do have some for 2017.
"
Person1,"They're significantly hedged as it relates to 2016 and rough numbers, about half of that amount would be in 2017.
"
Person1,"Yes, [they don't say] specifically how would unwinds, I don't necessarily want to comment on that.
"
Person1,"I'm just saying [of their hedge position, they are about half as much] hedged in 2017 as they are in 2016.
"
Person1,"It all depends on when they put the hedges on and what month they were specifically hedging at what prices.
"
Person0,"Well, just in closing, I want to thank you for your time this morning.
"
Person0,"Thank you for your interest and support in OGE.
"
Person0,"We're excited about the future and really pleased with the progress we're making today.
"
Person0,"So have a great day and we will speak to you soon.
"
