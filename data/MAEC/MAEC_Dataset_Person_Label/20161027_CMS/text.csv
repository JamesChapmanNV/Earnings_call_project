Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"Good to hear your voice.
"
Person2,"Good morning <UNK>.
"
Person1,"It actually would work as a charge to the customer of the alternative energy supplier, not the energy supplier themselves.
"
Person1,"So the MISO study that the state requested really has several components.
"
Person1,"One is the feasibility of connecting the Upper Peninsula, which is not our service territory.
"
Person1,"Zone 2 in the MISO zone to Sault Ste.
"
Person1,"Marie and between Sault Ste.
"
Person1,"Marie and Ontario.
"
Person1,"Then looking at connecting the UP and the Lower Peninsula to an existing transmission project in Gaylord.
"
Person1,"Or starting a large gas plant constructed up north somewhere up in the UP.
"
Person1,"So it's a variety of studies and they are all pointing to one situation that's trying to be correct, and that is the resource adequacy issue.
"
Person1,"Because of our regulatory construct in Michigan, there is this loophole up in the UP that has caused a major cost shift up there.
"
Person1,"So they are trying to figure out a way to better serve the people of the Upper Peninsula.
"
Person1,"We participate to the extent that we are energy experts and the governor relies on us for our input and insights, but the study that they requested from MISO really will help frame up the situation, I would say.
"
Person1,"And when it is complete, we will certainly obviously take a look and see what the options are.
"
Person1,"Great, thank you.
"
Person2,"I don't know who you are talking about that's doing that.
"
Person2,"But people are constantly looking at should we build here, build there.
"
Person2,"When you are down in that general area, you might be talking about Illinois solutions.
"
Person2,"And you are probably aware that, for instance, Covert, one of the larger IPPs that is left, is hooked up to PJM.
"
Person2,"But they are in the process, potentially, of selling their plant.
"
Person2,"So these things are dynamic but I don't have a lot of specifics on that particular question.
"
Person2,"But I will tell you what I will do, I will double-check after I am off the call and if there is something of substance we know about, we will share that.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Great, thank you.
"
Person1,"And thanks for listening to our call today, everybody.
"
Person1,"We appreciate your interest and definitely appreciate your ownership.
"
Person1,"<UNK> and I look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in just a couple weeks.
"
