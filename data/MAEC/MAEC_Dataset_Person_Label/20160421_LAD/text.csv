Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"One is looking at current trends, it is kind of equal to where our overall fixed margins are coming in, a weighted portion of that is going to go towards the body shop, which has a gross profit margin of about 20 or 15 basis points lower than our CPN warranty work, so as we improve that business and get that back on track, it is going to weigh down our overall GP margin, but what we guided for the year is really consistent with what we saw in the quarter, and no real changes that we are anticipating on that.

Person0,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I am pretty confident that we would have had a reduction in days supply if it wasn't for the stop sales, so it is definitely at least 100% of the four days, because we know that in many of our Honda stores, we have 20% to 30% of our inventories that are frozen because of CRVs and Civics and Fits.
"
Person0,"I think that is a combination of both, I think that certified is the area that we are feeling it the most, we were down $240 per unit, and I think that is a function of a greater supply, but I think ultimately that is the top of our waterfall effect, and that is where we have to be able to capture those core products that eventually lead to the highly profitable value auto, so we are willing to sacrifice that in the short term.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We are not breaking out that comp at this point in time, I think that again, it is store by store, and trying to break it out by division.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, is it fair to say that they were comparable in the two divisions, the difference was is that the throughput at Lithia was a little softer than the throughput at DCH that was robust, but they are also coming off now their second year of being able to find those cost advantages, and I believe that DCH will continue on that, and I think that Lithia will again capture that $0.17 or so opportunity that was really out there.
"
Person0,"That hasn't quite been responded to, but will in coming quarters.
"
Person0,"Thanks <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Thank you for joining us everyone, and we look forward to updating you again in July.
