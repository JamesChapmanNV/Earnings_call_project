Person2,"<UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I'll answer that.
"
Person2,"We really aren't giving a whole lot of guidance for 2017 right now.
"
Person2,"We'll give much more or better clarity as we get into January and finish our planning process.
"
Person2,"With <UNK>'s question, our base right now is $1.691 billion.
"
Person2,"We expect that to be down a little bit this next quarter, call it around 1%.
"
Person2,"What <UNK> said in 2017 is we're going to try to hold that expense rate flat to maybe down a little bit.
"
Person2,"We're going to do our best with all the competing priorities to keep our expenses relatively flat for 2017.
"
Person2,"But we will give you more color as things get finalized from our operating plan.
"
Person2,"Good question, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"We had $33 million in MSR valuation income.
"
Person2,"$18 million was that valuation adjustment to the MSR.
"
Person2,"Every now and then you have to update and tune your prepayment models.
"
Person2,"Basically our asset valuation was lagging peers that we index and look against.
"
Person2,"So we had to adjust our prepayment models, which allowed us to take that $18 million in as a valuation adjustment.
"
Person2,"If you take that out, we had good hedge performance of $15 million.
"
Person2,"And that was just good performance in the TBAs that we had that we're hedging.
"
Person2,"Well, we had benefit in the basis impact.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"When we go through a planning process, we always have our business lines plan positive operating leverage.
"
Person2,"We want them to stay within the risk appetite of what they're trying to accomplish.
"
Person2,"So we're going to have a plan that puts together positive operating leverage.
"
Person2,"So, hopefully we will be able to generate and get improvement on efficiency, but we really aren't guiding to any specific number.
"
Person2,"It's really going to depend on the execution and what the market will allow us and what we can grow from a revenue perspective.
"
Person2,"We can control expenses, as <UNK> said.
"
Person2,"We will be very tough on expenses and do what we think is right for the long-term benefit of our Company and our shareholders.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, I think Tarullo's speech was very consistent with what he's been saying, really, for the last two or three years.
"
Person1,"He has been, I think, appropriately moving to adjust some of the initial Fed criteria around CCAR.
"
Person1,"He clearly, I think, believes that the CCAR process needs to be much tougher on the large [G50s] versus the large regionals like BB&T.
"
Person1,"So I think his speech simply to some degree codified his movement in that direction.
"
Person1,"But from our point of view, frankly, it does not change a lot because we have a robust CCAR process.
"
Person1,"We're not going to dismantle it just because we're under $250 billion today.
"
Person1,"It wouldn't make any sense.
"
Person1,"Number one, the way we are doing CCAR today, we actually benefit from it.
"
Person1,"We think it's a healthy process.
"
Person1,"So we would continue to base that as it is anyway, even if they had dropped the whole requirements.
"
Person1,"Certainly we would not drop it and then have to pick it back up if we did a strategic deal to put us over $250 billion.
"
Person1,"It was encouraging in that I think it signals that the intensity of change with regard to, really, banks under I think $500 billion is just not going to increase.
"
Person1,"In fact, it's kind of stable.
"
Person1,"As he said, the intensity of additional or increased scrutiny is on the [G50].
"
Person1,"That relatively is good news for us.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we constantly look at our balance sheet and always try to optimize our balance sheet.
"
Person2,"We are aware of what we have on our balance sheet on the long-term debt side.
"
Person2,"Potentially it could be something that we would evaluate as we enter into 2017.
"
Person2,"No decision has been made; nothing is final.
"
Person2,"Obviously there is potential opportunity there to maybe improve run rate, and improve efficiency and returns.
"
Person2,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I would say they'll continue to run down.
"
Person2,"We will probably average our securities down another $2 billion, give or take, from where they were.
"
Person2,"So they were down about $1 billion linked quarter second to third, and maybe down about $2 billion linked quarter from third to fourth.
"
Person2,"The rate hike is so late in December, it's not going to have a big material impact.
"
Person2,"You're getting the LIBOR benefit just crossing over at year end.
"
Person2,"So I wouldn't view that as material.
"
Person2,"We might be off 1 basis point, but you could be up 1 basis point in core margin.
"
Person2,"So it's pretty much a non-issue for fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"So, the energy portfolio is really just a very small portion of our strategy in Texas.
"
Person1,"We view the energy portfolio as more of a national kind of a strategy.
"
Person1,"I would expect it to continue to grow modestly as the overall industry continues to recover from the lower rates.
"
Person1,"With regard to Texas in general, our acquisitions on the city branches, our de novo branches are going extremely well.
"
Person1,"The Texas market overall is doing well.
"
Person1,"We're beginning to see a little bit of softness in Houston around some multifamily and others, which you might expect.
"
Person1,"Nothing dramatic, but you're beginning to see the effect of that a bit.
"
Person1,"Nowhere else, really, across Texas.
"
Person1,"So we're gaining momentum substantially.
"
Person1,"We have about a $7 billion or $8 billion operation in Texas at this point, which is strong.
"
Person1,"We're 14th in market share, up from 53rd in market share when we started in 2009.
"
Person1,"So Texas is still growing about 1,000 people a day.
"
Person1,"So we will continue to grow faster than market in Texas.
"
Person1,"And continue to build out our franchise with de novo types of branch expansions.
"
Person1,"We will certainly in the long term be in some acquisition, but that's not a part of our strategy today.
"
Person1,"Our organic strategy is playing very well.
"
Person1,"We love Texas, and Texas loves us.
"
Person1,"So we're having a lot of fun in Texas.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I would say our merger-related costs will probably be in the $20 million to $30 million.
"
Person2,"It's pretty much phasing down.
"
Person2,"This might be the last quarter of any substance.
"
Person2,"You have some little dribbles and drabs in maybe the first part of 2017.
"
Person2,"But I would say $20 million to $30 million, fourth quarter.
"
Person2,"At least double.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Leann.
"
Person0,"And thanks to everyone for joining us.
"
Person0,"If you have further questions today, please don't hesitate to call Investor Relations.
"
Person0,"This concludes our call.
"
Person0,"We hope you have a good day.
"
