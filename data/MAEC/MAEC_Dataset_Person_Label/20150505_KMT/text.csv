Person,Sentence
Person0,"Yes, so I'll pick up the aerospace.
"
Person0,"I think in aerospace we actually made one particular customer that we decided to let go.
"
Person0,"We decided that the margins weren't attractive enough and that's impacting our topline in aerospace, certainly.
"
Person0,"I think overall in Europe, we have -- I think we're holding our own.
"
Person0,"I'm happy with our industrial business overall.
"
Person0,"I think we are holding share or may be even slightly getting share in Europe.
"
Person0,"So I feel pretty comfortable there.
"
Person0,"I think we will continue to be challenged.
"
Person0,"I think Europe, the market in general, I don't see anything on the horizon.
"
Person0,"I would say it is getting better.
"
Person0,"So we're going to have to continue to do all the things we do even better to earn our new business as we had down the road here.
"
Person0,"More cars -- definitely better.
"
Person0,"But I think -- I don't see it -- I certainly don't see it in Q4.
"
Person0,"We continue a very disciplined approach and will be keeping you updated as we make progress.
"
Person0,"But nothing to report right now.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"We'll be in a much better position to comment on that in July.
"
Person1,"I think, to be frank, on that particular question, we'll especially be watching this quarter.
"
Person1,"So I'll defer that question til July.
"
Person1,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"From an inventory perspective, and I won't put numbers around quantifying the amount of inventory reduction because we do have a lot of moving parts, but I will say we are focused on not just with [unfinished] goods inventory, which will impact the margins, but also from a raw materials perspective, some inventory restrictions there in Q4.
"
Person1,"And I would think similar margin impacts in the quarter for Q4 as we experienced in Q3.
"
Person1,"So roughly 50 basis point is in Q3.
"
Person0,"Well, I think what I said was that we're going to continue to focus on the high end of the market.
"
Person0,"We continue to focus on customers who really value the expertise and the solutions that we provide.
"
Person0,"And in that end of the market, quite frankly, demand is high and we find opportunities.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"Good morning, Sam.
"
Person0,"Yes, we're going to have similar to what we said on phase 2.
"
Person0,"Phase 3 will be a mix of administrative reductions.
"
Person0,"And I want to emphasize that this is a structured program where we are changing processes.
"
Person0,"We brought in an outside consultant to help us through this change process.
"
Person0,"And so it's structured and disciplined with milestones.
"
Person0,"And so that is certainly a significant portion of what we're going to go through with phase 3.
"
Person0,"The second key driver here will be continued footprint restructuring.
"
Person0,"So it will be a mix similar to phase 2.
"
Person1,"Yes, Sam.
"
Person1,"This is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I'll put it this way, the ending balance of goodwill on the infrastructure segment of $112 million is lower than the goodwill that we added through the Tungsten Materials acquisition.
"
Person1,"So you can read into it that way.
"
Person0,"Morning, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Yes, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"That isn't usually something that I think we ever shared that kind of detail on our product line.
"
Person0,"I can tell you that the one thing we have shared is that we -- the portion of the business that we are looking at divesting, we certainly -- that's well below the average profitability that we have in the business.
"
Person0,"So it will be a net improvement going forward.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"But, look, we are very competitive in many markets.
"
Person0,"And there's a range that we've never talked about what that ranges is and where.
"
Person0,"Yes, that would be something that we would cover as we divest.
"
Person0,"So we will give you some indication as we head down that path.
"
Person0,"As you can imagine, it just depends on the pieces, right.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"I think first, <UNK>, it depends on where in the world.
"
Person0,"So certainly in some areas in emerging markets you can get a multiple on industrial growth.
"
Person0,"But in areas -- infrastructure certainly not.
"
Person0,"And certainly in, I would call it the mature markets, where we have -- where you have continuous productivity gains, you're probably not going to see the kind of factors -- those kind of factors.
"
Person0,"Because people get more and more productivity out of the tools that the use.
"
Person0,"So I just don't see that.
"
Person0,"Can you rephrase that, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I'm not sure I understood question.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"So first of all, we certainly see opportunities for improvement.
"
Person0,"And I mentioned in my last call, and certainly we mentioned this several times, it's one of our top three priorities.
"
Person0,"We're just not quite yet in a position where we can lay out what is the endpoint.
"
Person0,"Our goal is to lay that out with our strategic plan when we lay that out at the end of the year.
"
Person0,"I will say, though, it's tied to these -- the portfolio realignment.
"
Person0,"We need to get that behind us in order to be clear on what our working capital goals will be.
"
Person0,"So first step is portfolio realignment and we'll be in a better positioned to talk about what's possible.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
