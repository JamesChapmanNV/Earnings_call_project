Person0,"Well, there was a couple of things, Dave.
"
Person0,"First of all, you've got, obviously, all the development but also the additional headcounts we brought in to assist with the migrations for the move to the new payments platform.
"
Person0,"And those costs are going to be around for the next 18 months or so.
"
Person0,"At that point, when we get all the customers off on the platforms, we'll have to shut down one of the platforms.
"
Person0,"We'll be getting rid of or displacing a lot of development people and a lot of the migration staff.
"
Person0,"So you're going to see a really see nice pop in margins there.
"
Person0,"The other thing that we're having to kind of grow over is all the development we've done in all these products in the previous 3 or 4 years for the treasury services, the ERMS solution, all those.
"
Person0,"So depreciation and amortization are both up quite a bit.
"
Person0,"And so we've got the costs that's rolling out there.
"
Person0,"But yes, we still -- now we're just getting the sales going.
"
Person0,"And so we're going to have to ratchet up the live customers on those to even offset the increased amortization and depreciation.
"
Person0,"So that's going to happen slowly over the next, probably, 3 or 4 quarters that we'll be able to grow over that.
"
Person0,"And that should give a little relief on margins or at least help to maintain the margins where we (inaudible) to offset the increased costs for the move on the payments platform.
"
Person0,"And then when we get to shut down the payments platform, that's when you're going to see a huge increase in margins.
"
Person0,"Because, again, that's over 20% of our total revenue right now that you're going to see a significant pop in margins.
"
Person0,"For fiscal '18, well, we're going to finish this quarter at $0.93 to $0.95, which will put us full year with the impacts of TJCA (sic) [TCJA] in the $4.69 to $4.71 range.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Had a couple of questions.
"
Person2,"Maybe little bit looking out a little longer term.
"
Person2,"On a theoretical basis, how do you feel about selling to FinTech disruptors.
"
Person2,"Reading a lot in American Banker as well as the some of the other publications about some of these new companies coming out offering a lightweight core, maybe offering some payment capabilities.
"
Person2,"On a theoretical basis, are you marketing to those.
"
Person2,"Or you view that as something that impacts negatively your target market of regular banks and credit unions.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So it's a good question, Pete.
"
Person1,"It's a fine line that we walk in that discussion.
"
Person1,"We don't want -- we're committed to the idea that we are not going to set ourselves up to be a competitor with our traditional customers.
"
Person1,"So with that in mind, where are those opportunities where we can maybe partner with a traditional customer to enable them with a FinTech.
"
Person1,"So we are not -- we are open to the idea -- instead of 2 negatives here, I'll say, we're open to the idea of working some of those partnerships.
"
Person1,"We have some of those discussions ongoing today.
"
Person1,"But we're very careful about the point of not positioning ourselves to compete with our traditional customers.
"
Person1,"And by the way to your point about the lightweight core and being nimble and gathering online deposits, that's actually a topic in my discussion for next week because we are -- we will be offering that type of solution to our customers with products -- solutions that we already have at Jack Henry.
"
Person1,"So that's -- we're well positioned to compete in that space with what we already have.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"That's helpful.
"
Person2,"And then just a follow-up on Ensenta.
"
Person2,"I've read through the description of what Ensenta does, and I've read through some of your material.
"
Person2,"And I guess, I'm still not completely clear on some of the additional capabilities that Ensenta brought to Jack Henry.
"
Person2,"And maybe you can give us some examples of other areas where it either solidified a lead or added new capabilities.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"So if you think about our traditional Enterprise Payments business, we were very strong in commercial deposits, working with commercial customers, particularly on the banking side of our business.
"
Person1,"So we're the most widely installed solution in that space.
"
Person1,"We had some penetration on the credit union side and we had some penetration for consumer deposits, but we were not industry leader in that space.
"
Person1,"And the reason we weren't the industry leader is because Ensenta was.
"
Person1,"So if you put Ensenta together with our EPS platform, we have the industry-leading solution for commercial deposits, consumer deposits, mobile deposits, essentially across the board.
"
Person1,"Additionally, Ensenta brought to us technology for working in the ATM environment that we didn't have and the shared branching environment on the credit union side for processing payments.
"
Person1,"Neither of those were huge part of their business, but it broadened our suite, which of course is what we're always looking to do on the ProfitStars.
"
Person1,"The is a ProfitStars solution, by the way.
"
Person1,"So always looking to broaden that offering on the ProfitStars side to try and fill as many holes as we can for those customers who do business with ProfitStars.
"
Person1,"And of course, many of them are noncore Jack Henry customers.
"
Person1,"So we have to have a best of breed, very broad offering to be competitive in that space.
"
Person0,"They also brought us some best of breed risk solutions.
"
Person1,"Yes, right.
"
Person1,"Yes, risk management technology around payments that we -- we had a very solid offering, but they had a better offering.
"
Person1,"So that augmented that piece of our story as well.
"
Person0,"Thanks, Olivia.
"
Person0,"As Dave mentioned, I want to remind everyone that we are having our annual Analyst Day next Monday afternoon at the Omni in Atlanta, which the afternoon presentations will be webcast.
"
Person0,"We're doing it just like we have in the past.
"
Person0,"We're going to have all of our group presidents.
"
Person0,"Greg Adelson, our GM of Payments and our National Sales Manager will all do presentations as will Dave and I and Mark Forbis, our CTO.
"
Person0,"There will be open Q&A.
"
Person0,"And then in the evening, there will be a mini tech fair, where I believe, we have 6 of our hotter products that will be shown there, which includes Banno, treasury services, the ERMS and the new payments platform will all be shown there.
"
Person0,"So we still got some open slots.
"
Person0,"If you want to go, you can either e-mail myself or Vance Sherard.
"
Person0,"So to wrap up, we're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers.
"
Person0,"I thank our associates for their hard work.
"
Person0,"Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders.
"
Person0,"I want to thank you again for joining us today.
"
Person0,"And Olivia, will you please now provide the replay number.
