Person,Sentence
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"We think -- the amount that we estimated that would have been in 2016 that's getting pushed into the later period is about $7 million -- the operating -- it's $70 million of revenue and equivalent amount of margin at the operating income, sorry, I misspoke.
"
Person1,"So, that's being pushed from what would have been in 2016 and into 2017.
"
Person1,"Yes, we were thinking that would be high single-digits margins.
"
Person1,"I'm sorry, please speak --
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I'll just -- the contract churn, if you will, for the quarter was $23 million of revenue and negligible at the operating income level.
"
Person1,"Just remember, with the full year, it was revenues of about $76 million and the impact was of $10 million at the operating income.
"
Person1,"We expect that $10 million figure to translate similarly into 2016, about the same revenue number too.
"
Person1,"I mentioned, our net debt position at the end of this past year was $831 million.
"
Person1,"Our ratio was 2.8 times.
"
Person1,"So I expect to make a meaningful debt reduction with the improved cash flow position we have, as well as change in the dividend strategy.
"
Person1,"So I'm looking for a $20 million to $50 million reduction in net debt by the end of the year.
"
Person1,"Now, we didn't talk about -- there's obviously other levers we can pull and we will consider them as we need to, not the least of which is a discussion each quarter that we consider relative to our ability to pay our Brand payment in kind or cash.
"
Person1,"Yes, most of the inventory build that I was referring to is all related to in fact these contracts with SBB.
"
Person1,"As you'll recall in 2014, we received some sizable advances.
"
Person1,"We began the inventory buildup over the course of this past year.
"
Person1,"That of course will continue.
"
Person1,"So that's really the lion's share of inventory buildup I was referring to.
"
Person0,"Yes, <UNK>, I don't actually see us exiting our position.
"
Person0,"We remain very optimistic for the prospects of that business.
"
Person0,"As much so as we did when we inked the deal over two years ago.
"
Person0,"As <UNK> noted, one thing we will consider and we consider every quarter is whether we make a payment toward venture partner in cash or allow ourselves to be diluted somewhat.
"
Person0,"So that's a decision that we will make quarter to quarter.
"
Person0,"A wholesale exit of our position is really not contemplated.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"So we have been talking about our backlog throughout the year.
"
Person1,"We started the year with a very strong backlog, as we've discuss each quarter, we've continued to deliver on that backlog, which certainly and we were sort of experience that indications that the business was declining.
"
Person1,"With our lag -- with the lead time associated with our business, it's usually six to 12 months in advance.
"
Person1,"So, we have seen this coming throughout the year.
"
Person1,"I think we are experiencing it full time now.
"
Person1,"I forget your second question, I apologize.
"
Person1,"What was your second --
"
Person1,"Yes, we are expecting the situation as exist today to more or less continue as it is today.
"
Person1,"We don't expect any meaningful improvement.
"
Person1,"Frankly, we don't expect any -- we're not anticipating any significant deterioration.
"
Person0,"Just to add to that, even if we did see an improvement in oil prices given the lead times that we have on the Air-X-Changer product as well as the inventory that's in the channel today, it's unlikely that we see much left in our business this year.
"
Person0,"We are seeing growth there.
"
Person0,"As you know a quite a small business.
"
Person0,"We have introduced a number of new products there.
"
Person0,"We have taken inventory out, it's really a very good story.
"
Person0,"Of course since largely goes into nonresidential construction, hospitals and education and help so forth.
"
Person0,"That business we expect to grow this year.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"You know historically seasonality of our business is such that the first half and in particular first quarter is our weakest quarter of the year.
"
Person1,"So where we see the traditional improvements, it's just seasonality driven through Rail and Industrial and all the businesses frankly as the orders increased.
"
Person1,"But we also will start to realize the full-year benefit of the cost reduction initiatives that we've taken in Metals from Project Orion in Orion's Phase 2 and Phase 3, as well as the corporate cost reductions that we have planned for as well.
"
Person1,"So it basically reflects the full-year picking up those benefits in the second half.
"
Person0,"Honestly, there's not a lot to share.
"
Person0,"We spend a lot of time getting ready for the process.
"
Person0,"We have had some discussions.
"
Person0,"We don't have a strong view yet on a spin versus a sale.
"
Person0,"I think the most important message certainly as we are very committed to this process and remain convinced that it's a key lever to unlock value for our shareholders.
"
Person1,"Yes, we have been talking about the potential for contract tenders and awards predominantly in Europe and India including the UK by the way in that category.
"
Person1,"So when I was referring to tenders that we hope to hear conclusions on in the near-term, I am looking mostly towards Europe.
"
Person1,"Yes, at least one of the ones I'm referring to is of the magnitude that absolutely similar in size to one of the SBB contracts, yes.
"
