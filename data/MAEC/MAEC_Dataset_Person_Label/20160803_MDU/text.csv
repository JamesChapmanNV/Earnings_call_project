Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person5,"Hello, <UNK>.
"
Person5,"It is <UNK>.
"
Person5,"We have a Line Section 25 expansion project that we are going to filing with FERC here and so we are starting off on that and that is what is driving it.
"
Person5,"That's going to be compression at basically three locations, Charbonneau, Williston and Tioga and so that is what is driving the capital increase.
"
Person5,"Well, certainly the exit of the E&P and refining, there is a lot less exposure directly with commodity prices.
"
Person5,"I mentioned to folks, I look at WTI maybe three times a week and not three times a day as I used to.
"
Person5,"When we think about, we will still have exposure to the general economies that surround the E&P business.
"
Person5,"Again, North Dakota the Bakken is in our backyard.
"
Person5,"We enjoyed some very nice customer growth, investment opportunity at the utility.
"
Person5,"We moved organically Knife River into that market and enjoyed some strong workloads there.
"
Person5,"So while we have some exposure there, I'll point out, as <UNK> mentioned, Knife's in 17 different states; so there is some exposure there, but at the same time it isn't all eggs in one basket.
"
Person5,"I think it is more economic risk.
"
Person5,"It's not direct price commodity risk.
"
Person5,"And then actually, there are some things up in <UNK>'s business.
"
Person5,"He goes through a lot of diesel every year running those big heavy equipment around.
"
Person5,"We actually see some benefit with lower commodity prices and actually asphalt oil business can be favorable in certain markets like that too.
"
Person5,"There's certainly some exposure, as probably all companies have, from an economic perspective, but it is a lot less direct affected from an income statement with commodities.
"
Person1,"Okay, thanks <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Good morning, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Thank you for the question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I would say this last quarter was pretty important strategically that we have done some of those things you just talked about.
"
Person1,"The exit of the E&P and the refining were very conscious decisions on our part.
"
Person1,"And we think strategically that makes us a much less volatile Company and less exposed to commodity.
"
Person1,"And we really are centered on a two-platform business, that being regulated energy delivery, that is through <UNK> and <UNK>'s business along with construction materials and service, <UNK> and <UNK>'s business.
"
Person1,"So we think those are two great platforms; they can complement each other and we think they are very core at MDU Resources.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I appreciate everyone again for participating on our call here this morning.
"
Person1,"As noted earlier, our continuing operations delivered strong results for the second quarter of 2016.
"
Person1,"We are committed to continue building on this momentum by focusing on those factors that we can most directly influence, those being controlling costs, expanding margins along with growing earnings.
"
Person1,"We appreciate you being on the call here today and we thank you for your continued interest in MDU Resources.
"
Person1,"Thank you and we will turn it back to the operator, <UNK>.
