Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"The, <UNK>, your -- well, thanks for the comments on the margin.
"
Person0,"It is a primary focus for us to continue to be extremely competitive on margins, and do what we can to remove cost.
"
Person0,"As the wireless business wound down last year, we absorbed about $25 million of costs that is now behind us, and is absorbed within the business.
"
Person0,"So we're going to continue to focus on cost, as well as trying to drive as much price as possible.
"
Person0,"I think we've said in previous calls, that our margins would be in the high 30%s.
"
Person0,"We think that that's probably the low point, and we'll do everything we can to get it up in the 40%s, in the low 40% margin range.
"
Person1,"(Multiple speakers) This is <UNK>, but for the year, really what we're expecting, and what we said is, lower hardware for the year, which will impact margin dollars and our EBITDA.
"
Person1,"So yes, from a trending standpoint, it does look like we're ending up, just above the higher end of the range.
"
Person1,"But we're still pretty comfortable with our guidance range.
"
Person1,"From the standpoint of technology, yes, look, we stay abreast to all the movements in the industry.
"
Person1,"Obviously, it's like the wild west right now.
"
Person1,"But we're huge believers that ultimately it comes down to having the best and biggest pipe to the home, period, and that's what we focus on.
"
Person1,"We've got a fantastic product team, fantastic technology folks looking at this.
"
Person1,"We believe Verizon's look at a skinny bundle is probably what the customers want for the future.
"
Person1,"Over-the-top optionality was mentioned earlier in the call, another thing customers want.
"
Person1,"So we stay abreast, and on top of everything, but ultimately the big pipe wins.
"
Person1,"(Multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"Are we okay with it.
"
Person1,"(Laughter).
"
Person0,"It continues to get squeezed.
"
Person0,"There's no doubt about it.
"
Person0,"But we're -- the ability to bundle that product with broadband is so important.
"
Person0,"And so, we look for other ways to take costs out, as well as trying to get margin.
"
Person0,"So that's where the focus is, and so far we've been very successful.
"
Person0,"We plan to do the same in the future.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, we have not seen a lot of additional competition, especially in the enterprise space.
"
Person0,"The thing that we have is, we have excellent relationships in Cincinnati with the enterprise customer base, and actually we're seeing growth in our largest customers.
"
Person0,"So we really haven't seen any strong competition from that merger at all.
"
Person0,"Yes, one of the moves we've recently made, and we're putting a lot of focus on is the commercial SMB marketplace.
"
Person0,"When we, as we talked earlier, the migration of companies from TDM to VoIP, we lose about 30 points of margin, 30 to 40.
"
Person0,"This gives us a hole that we, in the past we've tried to manage down.
"
Person0,"What we're trying to do is develop a product line and bundle that we can then, fill that hole with.
"
Person0,"So we think there's a big opportunity in that marketplace, and we're putting a lot of focus in there to develop products such as you said, to grow in that space.
"
Person0,"So we think that's a big opportunity.
"
Person0,"The other thing is taking that -- those products in other regions, or other markets.
"
Person0,"We're in Columbus, Louisville and Indianapolis, and they're all very applicable there as well.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"(Laughter) We do look at -- <UNK>, this is <UNK>, we do look at that currently.
"
Person1,"So we do look at adjusted EBITDA on trending basis for that.
"
Person1,"And we, for the most part that gets a little bit clouded because some of the investments we've made.
"
Person1,"Obviously, what we've said in the past is, as you invest in fiber, you're also -- the acceleration of that investment digs a bit of a hole initially.
"
Person1,"But if you look at it over time, it's declining slightly, but you see it flattening out.
"
Person1,"And I think when you adjust for those investments, accelerating your fiber optics, it looks a lot more plausible from the standpoint of turning the corner from a profitability standpoint.
"
Person1,"So that's a lot of what we look at is, EBITDA on an adjusted basis.
"
Person1,"Thoughts around all of it.
"
Person1,"We're looking at it all very closely.
"
Person1,"Obviously, with the most recent moves with the sub notes, and I do want to highlight we have, as of today, we no longer have sub notes on the balance sheet, which is a great thing for this Company.
"
Person1,"But yes, we are looking at that right now.
"
Person1,"We've got a strategy going forward.
"
Person1,"We're obviously keeping very close eye on high yield market.
"
Person1,"But yes, we're obviously analyzing that on a weekly basis.
"
Person1,"Hey, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person1,"The costs are already embedded in the ARO liability.
"
Person1,"So this is an ongoing -- it's an ongoing operation.
"
Person1,"We are accelerating a little bit.
"
Person1,"We had initially planned from a cash flow standpoint, this to hit over a two year period.
"
Person1,"But we decided, from an operational efficiency standpoint, was to just do it all at once, and get it all done.
"
Person1,"It was much more efficient, actually saved us a little bit of money.
"
Person1,"But the dollars we're talking are not major.
"
Person1,"I believe they're around $10 million to $15 million.
"
Person1,"So and again, it's already on the balance sheet.
"
Person1,"No, I'm sorry, over the year.
"
Person1,"So we had initially projected to do that as slowly as possible.
"
Person1,"So that $10 million to $15 million we'd spread out a few years, but just looking at the efficiency -- we'll shoot to have that done this year.
"
Person1,"Yes, it gets a little more complicated than that, with discontinued operations.
"
Person1,"If you look at the financials, I would start there.
"
Person1,"And then, if you have questions we could walk you through after the call.
"
Person1,"We could walk you through discontinued ops.
"
Person1,"But it gets -- it's a little trickier than that.
"
Person1,"The $54 million increase was associated with the transfer of the lease obligations, the remaining lease obligations to the core business effectively.
"
Person1,"Yes, we'll follow up afterwards.
"
Person1,"But the best way to think about it is -- all right.
"
Person1,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"So the best way to think, prior to the close of a business, those assets and liabilities sit in the wireless business.
"
Person1,"And then effectively, what's remaining, what's just shifted over into the balance sheet on the core business was the remaining liability, the obligation of the remaining leases.
"
Person1,"And the best way to think about it, it's just debt, right.
"
Person1,"We now have a debt obligation for capital leases.
"
Person1,"We have contracts on those.
"
Person1,"And the way I think of it, that's just debt for the core business, and we'll pay that out over time.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, do you have any other comments on that.
"
Person1,"That's right.
"
Person0,"And the $25 million that <UNK> was referring to, is sitting in discontinued operations liabilities in both periods.
"
Person0,"We can talk offline.
"
Person1,"Yes, discontinued ops was pretty complex.
"
Person1,"<UNK> and his team did a good job, and we'll go through a lot of detail in the Q.
"
Person1,"But if you have any questions, which I have a feeling we'll have quite a few, please call us.
"
Person0,"Yes, we think it would be slightly positive.
"
Person0,"We have eight stores.
"
Person0,"We've converted them all to fioptics stores, where they're not only selling, but demonstrating our product, as well as servicing for customers.
"
Person0,"So it's -- every one of them is a great experience, and we're finding out it's very good channel for sales.
