Person,Sentence
Person2,"<UNK>, so the first thing, I will answer the first part of that.
"
Person2,"There were no change in the number of days for us in Q1 versus Q1 of last year.
"
Person2,"So they both stayed the same that way.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, this is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person3,"I'll address the second half of your question.
"
Person3,"As <UNK> alluded to, we've hired a VP of sales for the robotics division, and we will be looking for a senior executive for the trauma divisions.
"
Person3,"Hope to have that slot filled by the third quarter.
"
Person3,"And they're going to be beginning their efforts to build out field sales management and then go into the rep level towards the end of this year.
"
Person3,"At this point, we're not going to share any target numbers with you but we will keep you posted as we move through.
"
Person2,"Tough to answer in the hypothetical sense, but you would think that if you were to have less attrition and more on-boarding I would think that we would deliver higher numbers.
"
Person2,"I would always shoot to say they would be in line or better than previous quarters, Kaila.
"
Person2,"I think the way to answer that right now is, again, as we look to exit this year at 7% guidance, as we have said, we would talk about the remainder of those years needing a CAGR for the sales of spine to be roughly 10% to 10.5% CAGR.
"
Person2,"Right now, I do not think I'm going to set 2017 guidance, I want to get another quarter under our belt, I want to look and analyze where we are with this.
"
Person2,"So I guess my advice to the Street would be, let's talk separately and understand where those models are falling out.
"
Person2,"But I'm not ready to make a commitment to that level for 2017.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, you know we give annual guidance and we feel really comfortable about our annual guidance.
"
Person1,"We don't want to comment on quarters.
"
Person1,"We are working really hard to make sure that we can improve on our sales force expansion.
"
Person1,"And that's all I'm willing to say at this point.
"
Person1,"Absolutely.
"
Person1,"We had a strong quarter of product introductions.
"
Person1,"We launched six products in the quarter, and we have several more in the pipeline with the agency as well as in production.
"
Person1,"And we are looking forward to having an extremely strong product introduction year this year.
"
Person3,"In terms of trauma, that is correct.
"
Person3,"We're going to be going to the FDA for sure by the third quarter with our initial trauma products, and hopefully get through the FDA pretty quickly.
"
Person3,"So we will be looking to hire reps early in 2017.
"
Person3,"For the imaging, navigation, and robotics division we will be hiring reps this year.
"
Person3,"We plan to go to the FDA in the second quarter with that product.
"
Person3,"And again, we're not sure how long it will take to get through, but we will be hiring at the rep level for that division during this year.
"
Person1,"Thank you for your question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Not really, I do not think that there's any new information in this article.
"
Person1,"It is an article with an extremely small number of patients, and a lot of confounding variables within those patients.
"
Person1,"But surgeons to date don't fuse everyone with spondylolisthesis.
"
Person1,"It's always defined with the amount of instability that a patient has.
"
Person1,"So there is not really a whole lot of new information, and I do not think this is going to affect treatment going forward.
"
Person1,"The patients who were treated before with fusions for back pain are really no longer in the system, and that was more the controversial group subset of patients.
"
Person1,"Spondylolisthesis patients with instability were getting fusions, and I think they will be getting fusions in the past -- in the future.
"
Person1,"It is really spondys with less -- you have to define spondylolisthesis from grade one through grade four, and then there are so many different factors that a surgeon -- before he makes up his mind to fuse or not to fuse.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, I would think it's at least the area to grow from.
"
Person2,"And so I don't know if we will see sequential growth along those lines.
"
Person2,"The anticipation from our model is that we would.
"
Person2,"I don't think it's necessarily related to just the timing of distributor, but many other factors.
"
Person2,"So, yes, I think I'm looking for a stronger Q2, and as we go forward into the full year, getting up to at least a double-digit number.
"
Person2,"So we don't normally throw that out with our guidance, we usually just do the sales and EPS.
"
Person2,"We don't think there will be anything special or unusual with cash flow this year that we're aware of currently.
"
Person2,"And there's not an increase in restricted cash, rather a constriction of it, because as we settled out our DePuy litigation in Q4, we reflected that on our P&L.
"
Person2,"In Q1, we're actually making a payment and returning some items to cash.
"
Person2,"So that's really what you see is that restricted cash set aside for that litigation now coming back into the mainstream.
"
Person0,"Thank you very much.
"
Person0,"At this point, we conclude our first-quarter earnings call.
"
Person0,"Appreciate everyone for participating, and we'll be in the office tomorrow if you have any follow-up calls, will be happy to help you out.
"
Person0,"Thanks very much for the call.
