Person1,"That's a good question and I have the same answer as before.
"
Person1,"We're keeping a close eye on it and we'll decide if that's something we need to go after.
"
Person1,"As of this moment we're not heading down the peer-to-peer path.
"
Person1,"If you really think about the way CarMax works, the fact that we make a cash offer on every car, is enabling a lot of peer-to-peer transactions and some of those are coming through us that would have otherwise gone peer to peer.
"
Person1,"A customer who normally would have put their car online before or put up in their yard and put a for sale sign on it, now a lot of those customers are bringing their cars directly to us and selling it to us.
"
Person1,"I may not be exactly the way you're thinking of it but I think we're getting plenty of customers who would have gone through the peer-to-peer channel and are deciding to sell their car directly to CarMax.
"
Person1,"We're evaluating all different options and we're open to any way that makes our business better and delivers a better return for our shareholders.
"
Person1,"On the first question, that number's been around 30% for quite a long time now.
"
Person1,"But that's a big number.
"
Person1,"We sold 600,000 cars last year which means we transferred roughly 200,000 cars at the customer's request to the store nearest them and then sold the car.
"
Person1,"We're transferring as many cars or more than anybody else at the customer's request.
"
Person1,"When they see a great presentation of that car through our website, with 40 high-definition pictures and zoom capability, I think we'll continue to make progress there.
"
Person1,"But the number's been relatively flat.
"
Person1,"But again, it's a very big number.
"
Person1,"In terms of our regional differences, we never comment on regional differences.
"
Person1,"The only thing I'd tell you is I continue to be very proud of our CarMax team.
"
Person1,"Whenever we have a disaster in any area that involves large-scale loss of product, we're able to be there for the consumer when they are ready to buy something else.
"
Person1,"And we also are a place where people can get rid of their cars.
"
Person1,"If a car has flood damage or hail damage, we still make an offer on the car and we turn around and wholesale that car.
"
Person1,"We won't retail one of those cars but we still are there for the consumer when they need us in markets that have some trouble.
"
Person1,"But I can't really comment on any differences in performance.
"
Person1,"Okay.
"
Person1,"Being there's no further questions, I want to thank everybody for your interest in CarMax and for joining us on the call today.
"
Person1,"And I especially want to thank our over 22,000 CarMax associates nationwide for all you do every day to make CarMax such a success.
"
Person1,"And we'll talk to you guys next quarter.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
