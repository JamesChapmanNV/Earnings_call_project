Person3,"Good evening.
"
Person3,"It's <UNK>.
"
Person3,"I guess a couple of comments.
"
Person3,"When you think about Q1, we had both product and services growth in North America.
"
Person3,"I think that's an important point.
"
Person3,"We also grew the managed and support services 9%.
"
Person3,"As you alluded to, our backlog was up $575 million, again primarily driven by managed and support services, but we grew both segments.
"
Person3,"If you think about 2016 in total as we said, we'll grow the North American business.
"
Person3,"It continues to be a good environment for both the state -- both state and local and the federal business for us.
"
Person3,"Couple of things to think about is we've improved sales coverage so we're starting to see some return on that.
"
Person3,"And then, we're also -- we've gone into better data analytics in terms of our ability to target and capture additional software features on the equipment that we sell, the products that we sell.
"
Person3,"Again, as we said, we expect to grow in North American 2016.
"
Person3,"So, <UNK>, our backlog as we see it today has trended more towards devices.
"
Person3,"We've certainly seen, particularly in Q1 and the back half of 2015, our mix has really gone to devices over infrastructure.
"
Person3,"But, I will add that we've obviously seen with the backlog growth we've seen, the return of some large scale projects.
"
Person3,"State of Iowa and those kind of deals.
"
Person3,"It's a pretty good mix.
"
Person3,"As we said, big growth in services.
"
Person3,"Some growth in devices as well.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, do you have anything to add.
"
Person2,"The only thing I'll add, <UNK>, is from a duration perspective, clearly the managed and support services is a longer duration, multi-year contracts.
"
Person2,"Product is typically a shorter duration, although in products we could have system deployments that would extend several quarters.
"
Person0,"Next question, please.
"
Person3,"Okay.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, it's <UNK>.
"
Person3,"So, I guess in regards to EMEA first, obviously Q1 was up 4% ex-currency.
"
Person3,"But, when you look at the business organically, obviously we were down 26% in EMEA.
"
Person3,"And, a large part of that is due to the fact of our Norway, the integration runoff and the comps there.
"
Person3,"We also saw a decline in devices.
"
Person3,"The other piece of it is if you think about EMEA, we've had some pockets of weakness in the channel at the low end, particularly in Europe.
"
Person3,"But, again, we continue to see -- when you start to think about the region in 2016, we'll see continued pressure in the first half with the runoff of Norway, as well as FX.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, I don't know if you have anything you want to add as it relates to the second part of the question.
"
Person2,"Well, the second part of the question being confidence in the full year.
"
Person2,"So, if we look at our backlog aged into the second half, it's comparable to what it was last year, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"And, clearly in the first half, the first half Latin America, specifically, Q1 and Q2 have been hit hard from a year-over-year perspective.
"
Person2,"If we look at what happened last year in Latin America, Q1 and Q2 were reasonable quarters and really the fall-off happened in Q3 and Q4.
"
Person2,"So, combination of order activity, increasing backlog, and visibility that we have into the second half give us confidence for -- the expectation isn't for significant growth rates in the second half, but certainly better than performance in the first half.
"
Person2,"Yes, a couple things to think about, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Q1 2015 was abnormally high.
"
Person2,"As you know, Q1 is typically our smallest quarter due to timing of some of the receivables.
"
Person2,"If you look at our trailing 12-month, we're ahead of where we were the prior year.
"
Person2,"So really, we were expecting cash flow to be lower in Q1.
"
Person2,"It was driven by higher incentive payments for 2015 performance versus 2014, variable pay payments, the majority of which are paid out in Q1, and higher tax payments.
"
Person2,"And, working capital, working capital was a source of cash in Q1 2016, just not as large of a source as it was in Q1 of 2015.
"
Person2,"As a matter of fact, from a cash conversion cycle, we improved four days in the quarter.
"
Person2,"So, we still expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year and free cash flow per share at $4.75 to $5.
"
Person2,"So, if we look at services, as you mentioned, the services gross margin were up year-over-year based on the Norway roll-off.
"
Person2,"We talked about services gross margin getting back to that mid-30% as our run rate, and that did happen.
"
Person2,"What happened in Q1 were really three things.
"
Person2,"There was an FX impact, a volume impact on the product side, and a mix shift from product to services.
"
Person2,"As services grew 6%, products contracted 7%.
"
Person2,"Those are really the three items that impacted Q1 margin.
"
Person2,"For the full year, we continue to expect full-year gross margin to be comparable to last year.
"
Person2,"You mentioned Airwave.
"
Person2,"Airwave does have a little bit lower gross margin than our base business.
"
Person2,"But, again, our expectation for the full year are gross margins comparable to what they were in 2015.
"
Person2,"We remain committed to return of capital.
"
Person2,"There is no change to the model.
"
Person2,"There is no change to the assumption of how much cash we need on the balance sheet to run the business.
"
Person2,"So, for planning purposes, the expectation of $750 million to $1 billion of share buyback is still a valid -- valid for planning purposes.
"
Person4,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person4,"This is <UNK> <UNK>.
"
Person4,"We've seen an increase in the managed services business, primarily driven by a couple of things.
"
Person4,"Number one, the smoothing of cash flows -- spend from our customers' perspective.
"
Person4,"Second, and maybe more importantly, is the complexity of the networks are increasing on an ongoing basis.
"
Person4,"Our customers don't have the resources or the capabilities to manage a lot of those.
"
Person4,"So, we've seen both an increase in what we would consider support and managed, so long software upgrade agreements and multi-year support plans.
"
Person4,"And, that's driven largely by North America, but also seen around the entire globe.
"
Person1,"Yes, on the first one, you're right.
"
Person1,"I think that we overperformed in Q1 against our original expectations.
"
Person1,"That was largely driven by North America.
"
Person1,"So, in Q2, our guidance, we think is prudent.
"
Person1,"Obviously, we're holding the full year.
"
Person1,"In Q2, specifically, we have pressure from Latin America, up probably about another $40 million.
"
Person1,"The roll-off of Norway of about $30 million.
"
Person1,"And, to your point, probably some revenue that we would have originally thought would have appeared in Q2 slid to Q1.
"
Person1,"When you net all of those ingredients, it's entirely first half and full-year as we expected.
"
Person0,"Backlog.
"
Person2,"Yes, with respect to the backlog question, as I mentioned earlier, we're approximately at the same position we were comparable to last year, aged in the year from a backlog perspective.
"
Person2,"And, with respect to Airwave, the incremental $1.8 billion, we've talked about a $450 million Airwave number.
"
Person2,"So, clearly, that $450 million would come out of the $1.8 billion of Airwave backlog.
"
Person1,"No.
"
Person1,"I'll let <UNK> <UNK> expand.
"
Person1,"But, we haven't.
"
Person1,"As we've mentioned with LTE in the four largest engagements that have been awarded in the world so far, we've won all four.
"
Person1,"Los Angeles, two countries in the Middle East, and the UK.
"
Person1,"But, simultaneously, we see continued investment in LMR, even with those LTE awards.
"
Person1,"We think that LTE is additive to LMR.
"
Person1,"We're seeing increased interest between the interoperability between LMR and LTE, hence the award I mentioned from the UK home office in Q1.
"
Person1,"So, no, we don't see any chilling effect on TETRA infrastructure in international markets as a result of LTE consideration.
"
Person3,"The one thing that I would add to that is the situation in the UK was unique in that they did not own either their spectrum or their network.
"
Person3,"So, they have a different decision than really every other customer we have or we serve around the globe.
"
Person3,"To the best of my knowledge, they are the only customer in the world that didn't own spectrum or network and, again, had a different set of options presented to them than any other customer we have with the TETRA network.
"
Person3,"Specifically to Airwave, <UNK>.
"
Person3,"Minimal CapEx in that business, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"Next question.
"
Person1,"In terms of China, first of all, we had one of our strongest years ever that I can remember in China last year.
"
Person1,"But, China was down about 25% in Q1, off of a high compare and some lumpiness in strong order activity.
"
Person1,"I think it will be down probably 20% or 25% for the full year, so we are not expecting any growth in China.
"
Person1,"Instead, we are expecting contraction of about 25% this year for the remainder.
"
Person3,"<UNK>, I guess maybe a couple comments on LatAm.
"
Person3,"I think the first point that I think is important, if you think about LatAm as a region, it's 5% of MSI's total revenues.
"
Person3,"The second thing I would say is to your point, when we think about the first half of the year, we were down 42% in Q1.
"
Person3,"Most of the pressure from a comparables perspective does reside and is the challenge for us in the first half of 2016, but I would really say, having obviously spent a good portion of time in the region that the situation remains fluid.
"
Person3,"Both from, I think, a natural commodities perspective and a macroeconomic perspective.
"
Person3,"Some countries are faring better than others, but it remains a challenge.
"
Person3,"I will say the one bright spot is we remained, and we will sustain our investment in the region, both from a go-to-market and from a technical resource because we do believe the market will rebound again.
"
Person3,"It's just tough to really put your finger on exactly when that will happen right now.
"
Person1,"So, <UNK>, I guess a comment.
"
Person1,"No, we don't necessarily see anything with the federal elections that will impact our business in the federal market.
"
Person1,"<UNK>mand really post-2013 has been pretty stable, pretty solid in our business, and really that's across the continuum for both product and services.
"
Person1,"So, no, we don't anticipate any impact or any slowdown as it relates to the upcoming election in our business in the federal market.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, we said $120 million total reduction year-over-year, and we did $43 million in Q1.
"
Person2,"So, the modeling for the back half of the year, the first half will be a little bit more from a reduction perspective than the second half.
"
Person2,"And, remember, the $120 million is a $120 million reduction year-over-year after the addition of approximately $30 million of Airwave OpEx.
"
Person2,"Really the reduction in the base business is approximately $150 million year-over-year.
"
Person1,"Just for second half.
"
Person2,"So, it really depends on the awards.
"
Person2,"They are different.
"
Person2,"Certainly, the services award would be aged over several years.
"
Person2,"They are multi-year awards.
"
Person2,"System deployments would likely be aged over several quarters.
"
Person2,"And then, there was some APX subscriber backlog that would be realized as revenue in 2016.
"
Person2,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"We appreciate everybody joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.
