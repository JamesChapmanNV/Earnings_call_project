Person1,"So, if you look at our -- when we talk about premium on move outs we don't talk about the rent roll down.
"
Person1,"What we are talking about is our average in place rents compared to our average street rate.
"
Person1,"And I would tell you that on average for the year it is mid- to high-single-digits depending on the time of the year.
"
Person1,"So in other words when we are raising rates in the summer that roll down or that negative mark is lower.
"
Person1,"But everybody does not move out in equal -- what I am saying is you have more churn -- our medium length of stay is six to seven months, but our average length of stay is 14 months.
"
Person1,"So you have a group of units that are constantly churning that have a very short length of stay.
"
Person1,"So, many of those customers never received a rate increase or received one rate increase.
"
Person1,"And some of those moved in below street rates.
"
Person1,"So when they move out it is actually very little impact, and also you have a large number of those that churn all the time.
"
Person1,"So our negative mark-to-market is different than our in place rents compared to our street rates.
"
Person1,"I am not sure I understand the question, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"I would tell you -- our average leases are fairly close to market and it is property by property.
"
Person1,"No, go ahead.

Person0,"Yes, that is a good question.
"
Person0,"So the earliest CofOs we delivered we stopped within a year most of them -- just way ahead of historical norms and underwriting.
"
Person0,"The more recent deals are leasing up between one and two years on average.
"
Person0,"So certainly the pace of lease up has slowed down, but we have underwritten all of these deals at 36 to 42 months.
"
Person0,"So they are not leasing up as fast as they were but they are still leasing up generally ahead of projections.
"
Person1,"So we actually have not put that out in the public.
"
Person1,"It is something we will consider looking at, but we put a management fee into our properties that is what we consider a cost to manage when we underwrite.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"The five boroughs as opposed to our New York MSA, which includes northern New Jersey and Long Island, had revenue growth in the fourth quarter under 2%.
"
Person0,"And for the year under 5%, about 4.7%.
