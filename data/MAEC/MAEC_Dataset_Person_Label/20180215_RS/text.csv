Person6,"My question was on the operating expense.
"
Person6,"I think we noticed the fourth quarter expenses were up quarter-on-quarter when you had seasonally weaker volumes.
"
Person6,"I would assume some of that is bonus accruals because you guys had a great year.
"
Person6,"But can you talk about the baseline operating expense environment, excluding what the comp may have -- comp component may have been, just because we're noticing that freight, other costs of doing business are higher.
"
Person6,"And then we're also trying to get a good run rate in terms of what we should be using for the first quarter.
"
Person4,"Phil, so on the SG&A expenses, fourth quarter is usually not as predictable as the other quarters of the year just because year-end true ups and things.
"
Person4,"But overall, because we do have in the fourth quarter holiday pay during that quarter.
"
Person4,"So even though we're not shipping as much, we're still paying our employees for the holidays.
"
Person4,"So that always effects the fourth quarter a bit.
"
Person4,"Other than that, certainly, yes, some of the freight costs are up, but -- and that hits our SG&A expense line, but we also pass -- that's part of what we charge our customers for, that's one of the services we provide, is delivering our product to them.
"
Person4,"And the majority of our delivery is done on our own trucks.
"
Person4,"So it's with our drivers that are our employees.
"
Person4,"So I think we're not seeing the squeeze that you hear from some other companies in our industry who are outsourcing it more to third parties.
"
Person4,"But certainly, fuel and some of those items are up.
"
Person4,"But again, in our model, we try to pass that through to our customers.
"
Person4,"So it hits the SG&A line, it could be a little higher, but the revenue line should also be a bit higher to cover that.
"
Person4,"Run rate going forward, if you look at like Q1, Q2 of last year, those are probably better normal type of SG&A run rates.
"
Person4,"We do -- we did again in 2018 as we have done consistently is provide wage increases to our employees.
"
Person4,"So you should expect our Q1 '18, or quarterly run rate in '18 to be a bit higher than in '17, just because of the inflationary factors related to wage increases, healthcare increases, et cetera.
"
Person6,"Okay.
"
Person6,"That's helpful.
"
Person6,"And I noticed in your, I think your nonferrous script, Bill, you had talked about some of the business that you're setting up outside the U.S., I think in Korea and maybe China.
"
Person6,"And I know semiconductor spending, I think, we've talked in the past, can be extremely volatile.
"
Person6,"It can be very strong at the good times and very weak at the bad times.
"
Person6,"So I'm just trying to balance out the timing of the investment that you all are making.
"
Person6,"And then what gives you confidence that you're making it at the right time given where the cycle is.
"
Person3,"Yes, Phil, you're right.
"
Person3,"It does tend to be somewhat volatile, but the outlook is really positive.
"
Person3,"We saw last year on the semiconductor side, it was extremely strong and that looks like it's going to carry through this year.
"
Person3,"The investments that we're making in Korea and China and some here in the U.S. are focused on the semiconductor market.
"
Person3,"And then the other investment, the new facility is All Metal Services in India, which is aerospace focused.
"
Person3,"And the outlook is very positive for all of that, which is one reason we're very comfortable making those investments.
"
Person4,"And in South Korea, Phil, we've been in that market, I think, about 15 years.
"
Person4,"So we're not a new player.
"
Person4,"We're not just jumping in because of the current outlook.
"
Person4,"We've been there in steel, we know that market pretty well.
"
Person4,"And we've been in China for a while now as well.
"
Person4,"So we do feel comfortable making those further investments in those operations.
"
Person1,"Basically, in South Korea, we've been there, as you pointed out, about 15 years, but we're basically doubling the size of our production capacity there, right, okay.
"
Person1,"So it's a good investment, but it's paying dividends as we speak.
"
Person1,"And I think, we're putting the money in at the exact right time.
"
Person6,"Are these for new customers or existing customers.
"
Person6,"I'm just trying to gauge the pole.
"
Person1,"Both, both.
"
Person1,"For some major customers that are expanding their operations and there's some new business in that also.
"
Person1,"But the vast majority is on existing customers expanding their production.
"
Person6,"And this is for industrial aluminum plate for the most part.
"
Person6,"Is that what we're talking about here.
"
Person3,"Some of that investment is the electro polish tubing that goes into the vacuum chamber industry.
"
Person3,"So it's not all plate driven.
"
Person3,"And the major investments that we're talking about in Korea and China are more tubing oriented than plate.
"
Person6,"And that's stainless steel.
"
Person3,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"We will.
"
Person1,"But the main question is, how much can we get capture like immediately upon announcement.
"
Person1,"As you know, the vast majority of our business, in particular, on carbon steel products, okay, spot business.
"
Person1,"So very little contractual business on that.
"
Person1,"So we literally take the position that when the announcement is made, as Jim just mentioned, $50 a ton on carbon steel plate was -- we learned about yesterday.
"
Person1,"That $50 a ton will be on our price books effective this morning.
"
Person1,"We'll get that with -- our work average order size is a little over $1,600 per order.
"
Person1,"So obviously we're doing business with a tremendous amount of job shots, smaller companies placing smaller orders.
"
Person1,"And those companies, okay, whether you're charging them $1,600 for an order or $1,650 or $1,700 it's not that big of a deal.
"
Person1,"So we can get a lot of those price increases at time of announcement.
"
Person1,"The more sophisticated companies, the large ag producers and what not, they recognize the fact that we've got 3 months on our floor inventory position.
"
Person1,"And it's not likely that they're going to pay at the time of announcement, but we'll get it, okay.
"
Person1,"It's just a matter of do you get it today or do you get it in 60 days from now.
"
Person1,"But at the end of the day, we get it.
"
Person4,"And that's where, <UNK>, you mentioned potentially trailing the indexes.
"
Person4,"And one of the things you have to think about is our product mix, and factor that in when you think about whatever indexes you're looking at and to what <UNK> was talking about, some of the mill increases that are effective in Q1, we already got in Q4 of '17.
"
Person4,"So depending on how you're comping us against the indexes out there, you've got to take that into consideration also.
"
Person1,"Let me tell you what I know about the 232 cases.
"
Person1,"I don't know anything about the gotdang 232.
"
Person1,"I'm so confused by the son of a gun.
"
Person1,"It was supposed to go into effect in June, didn't go end of June.
"
Person1,"It was supposed to go effect in August, it was supposed to go into effect in -- who the hell knows, okay.
"
Person1,"All I know is that Jim says we don't run our company based on hope.
"
Person1,"We run it based on what we know.
"
Person1,"And all we know is that imports are lower.
"
Person1,"We think they're going to be -- they're going to continue to go down somewhat, not probably at the percentage that they went down in, basically, the fourth quarter of the year, okay.
"
Person1,"But we think there's room for imports to continue to decline.
"
Person1,"We're hopeful that there's more price increases because we like prices higher than lower.
"
Person1,"But at the same time, we are -- we hope that the mills use some discipline so the spreads don't become so great that imports come in more.
"
Person1,"But if you want to get a really good answer to your 232, you better call the White House.
"
Person1,"You're barking up the wrong tree here.
"
Person2,"And <UNK>, just one thing to add, regardless of what they're calling it, there's countries who are cheating.
"
Person2,"I mean, there's laws on the books, and they're flat-out cheating and dumping product into The United States.
"
Person2,"That's a fact whether we decide to enforce the laws that're already on the book or add new laws that they're cheating and dumping product into the country.
"
Person6,"I think I just had a follow-up question on the LIFO, <UNK>, in terms of what your assumptions are behind that.
"
Person6,"Are you assuming that your pricing guidance levels for Q1 basically hold through the course of the year.
"
Person4,"Yes, so, we do have to make an estimate for the full year.
"
Person4,"So the $80 million expense is based on our current estimate with our outlook.
"
Person4,"So we do think that current pricing will hold and that there is room for further upside.
"
Person4,"Certainly, we've been in this business a long term.
"
Person4,"Prices go up and they go down.
"
Person4,"But our $80 million, we think does leave a little room for some fluctuation throughout the year.
"
Person4,"But overall, we expect our prices at the end of the year to be higher than they were at the beginning of the year.
"
Person4,"And we kind of compare -- the $80 million estimate is -- of expense is a little more than our actual 2017 expense of $73.3 million.
"
Person4,"So you can kind of use that as a guide of what pricing did in '17 to be what our expectations are for '18.
"
Person4,"And sorry, Phil, and also remember though, our inventory cost on hand at December 31, '17, which is our starting point, because the time lag doesn't -- did not reflect all the price increase announcements.
"
Person4,"So some of the price increase LIFO effect we'll get in '18 is based on Q4 '17 price increases as well.
"
Person1,"On behalf of our team here at Reliance, I'd like to thank all of you for participating in today's call.
"
Person1,"I'd also like to extend my gratitude to all our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders for their continued support and commitment to Reliance.
"
Person1,"We look forward to a successful year ahead and have a great day.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
