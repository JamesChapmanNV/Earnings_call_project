Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person2,"Oh no, first --1Q of 2016 versus 1Q of 2015.
"
Person1,"I don't know the number offhand.
"
Person1,"I can tell you that the demand is good -- very good, so I think days -- I don't know what the number is off the top of my head, but I think it is important that it is -- that demand is strong that we are experiencing.
"
Person1,"What we said, <UNK>, was that we have two specific groups of assets.
"
Person1,"One is the pipeline and rail facility that we acquired -- that Tesoro acquired at the beginning of this year.
"
Person1,"We expect to drop that down in the second part of 2016, and an acquisition that we will be making in Alaska with some additional distribution assets in -- combined with some existing Tesoro distribution assets in Alaska will be dropped down this year also.
"
Person1,"And we said that the combination of those two drop downs would probably provide EBITDA to TLLP on an annual basis in the range of $70 million to $100 million.
"
Person1,"We have to let that growth through our process -- evaluation process between Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics and the conflicts committee.
"
Person1,"So it is a formal process of set market rates and that, so it would just be premature for me to comment on that.
"
Person1,"We do look at comparables and see what other people are doing in the industry, but we also look at the nature of these type of aspects and the potential from a growth standpoint now.
"
Person1,"So it is just too early to say that, but you can get your own range from historical drop downs and that.
