Person1,"Well, <UNK>, I hope my marketing team is listening because I just asked them for that information just last week so no.
"
Person1,"It's very hard for us to get that data.
"
Person1,"Obviously, customers protect their yield, their quality data, et cetera.
"
Person1,"So we can -- we have various estimates, we know, you know, we have executives from the accounts tell us oh, you just saved us X millions of dollars in this one incident.
"
Person1,"Another time we'll get a story about being able to optimize recipes for a new product ramp that used to take a month now going down to hours.
"
Person1,"So we have anecdotal stories like that, but putting the actually quantifying it all and putting a dollar value on that that's been a little bit difficult.
"
Person1,"Something we're still working on.
"
Person1,"Well, RF filters is growing dramatically.
"
Person1,"I mean you can see, as Steve, mentioned double-digit CAGRs and that's continuing even as Smartphone, you know, growth is starting to slow and that's being driven on by growth in multiple -- in the use of these RF filters basically communication, wireless communication, in a number of devices whether it's on the mobile devices but also within the wireless home, the automotive, et cetera.
"
Person1,"MEMS is a similar trends.
"
Person1,"You look at the amount of sensors that diverse have today and how much more are being talked about we're seeing a lot of growth and new players coming into the MEMs market that's creating an opportunity and that's also estimated double-digit CAGRs.

Person1,"So I don't have an exact number for you.
"
Person1,"I think for us we're excited about those two markets because they pull in a large number of our tools that can be very relevant and when we put those tools together, we provide a differentiated value proposition for those customers versus just trying to sell them inspection and just being an inspection supplier.
"
Person1,"By having our unique MetaPULSE technology, our inspection and tying that in with software and then including the software including data from the process tools we're able to provide a really powerful value position for these customers.
"
Person1,"Does that mean it's $100 million a year.

"
Person1,"(Inaudible) specialty device.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"So I mean the category that -- we don't break it into subsets, <UNK>, you know, they have been running on a quarterly basis anywhere from 5% to 18%, you know, so depending -- 5% being the low period last quarter, but I mean typically 10 -- 10% on up to 15% to 18%.
"
Person2,"I think it's going to continue to be a strong portion of the business so yes -- I wouldn't commit to what it's going to be next year, but I would think we're going to continue to see some nice growth in those numbers, yes.
"
Person1,"Thank you, everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest and support of Rudolph.
