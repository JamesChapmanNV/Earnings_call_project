Person,Sentence
Person1,"Both.
"
Person1,"Depending on the product.
"
Person1,"Or depending on the need.
"
Person1,"For equipment, that is sold to a contractor that installs that equipment.
"
Person1,"In certain cases where it's what I will call basic products, I'll call it do-it-yourself products where that hotel or resort may have their own staff of people that put the chemicals in and do the basic maintenance, then that would be a direct sale.
"
Person1,"You make a very good point, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"And certainly it will be tougher.
"
Person1,"I would rather have a little bit more time to give you better insight.
"
Person1,"Again from an annual standpoint, we would be looking at, call it 5% to 6% topline growth for the year.
"
Person1,"A lot of it ,frankly in the first quarter depends on how mild the weather is in the snow belt in February/March and how, when people start opening their pools and then the rush of business that happens as people open up their pools.
"
Person1,"But you make an excellent point.
"
Person1,"And it could very well when we refine our commentary in February, we could very well be coming out and saying expect f<UNK>ttish-type numbers but, it doesn't change anything for the year.
"
Person1,"It just changes how it p<UNK>ys out over the quarter given the seasonality of the business.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"I would see that there would be the ongoing very -- from my standpoint, very slow gradual recovery of new pool construction and what will change is when financial institutions begin to open up a little bit, their horizons for home improvement lending to existing homeowners, and that's when it will really kick up and recover at an accelerated rate.
"
Person1,"Until then it will continue to grow at a modest, call it 10ish type percent, 5,000 to 7,000 more pools per year.
"
Person1,"Between blue, green and international, probably it would end up being another 5 to 7 locations for 2017.
"
Person1,"And so that will add, close to 1% of call it new sales, not necessarily base business.
"
Person1,"Acquisitions, at this juncture, that's very specu<UNK>tive.
"
Person1,"Certainly always talking to people and trying to figure some things out that would make sense for us long term as we -- I talked about a few minutes ago and a lot of those transactions historically over time happened in the wintertime frame after the season is over and before the next season.
"
Person1,"Overall, very solid throughout all of Europe.
"
Person1,"In fact, in euros and in Canadian dol<UNK>rs, which are, collectively Europe and then Canada are by far our two biggest international markets representing well over 90% what we do internationally.
"
Person1,"Both of those markets grew at a modestly faster rate than the US market.
"
Person1,"So they're both doing well.
"
Person1,"The UK is doing fine.
"
Person1,"In fact I reviewed those numbers.
"
Person1,"We're on track to be a little bit more profitable this year than <UNK>st year in Europe.
"
Person1,"So although -- and we have a good chance of hitting our budgeted profit there as well.
"
Person1,"So we're moving right along.
"
Person1,"I think the impact from Brexit will be more in the medium term, in the next several years as certain industries and finance sector and IT relocate.
"
Person1,"But again, the existing pools are the existing pools.
"
Person1,"They'll need to be maintained.
"
Person1,"Things break down, they'll need to be repaired and after a while, the product will need to be rep<UNK>ced or the pools remodeled.
"
Person1,"So I don't see any of that changing.
"
Person1,"On an annual basis just to give you a little context, in the UK, they build less than 2,000 new pools per year.
"
Person1,"And if you compare that, that would be analogous to a medium-sized market in Florida like for example I would say -- I mean they build more pools in that Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm and Tampa and Or<UNK>ndo.
"
Person1,"That's more like a Pensaco<UNK>-type market.
"
Person1,"The market is growing, just like the residential market is growing.
"
Person1,"But our growth is primarily -- our growth rate has been primarily driven by our growing market share.
"
Person1,"There is certainly the opportunity for M&A there.
"
Person1,"There are certain established distributors that focus on the commercial sector.
"
Person1,"We have talked to several of them over the course of time.
"
Person1,"But like we have done with the residential side of our business, if you look back at our history, there was a time way back when that there were a number acquisitions done to enter new markets.
"
Person1,"We pivoted off that about 15 years ago and the lion's share of our growth since then has been organic.
"
Person1,"Once we enter a market, the return on capital is far greater doing it organically.
"
Person1,"And we've also entered and opened locations in over 100 new markets over the course of time.
"
Person1,"So we can do it every which way.
"
Person1,"In the case of the commercial sector, location is not as important because the key there is the specialized talent that you need on working with the customers on a technical front as well as having the ability to create the bill of materials.
"
Person1,"And then separately having the right stocking so that it can be delivered same day next day.
"
Person1,"And so we can do that organically.
"
Person1,"I can't rule out an acquisition.
"
Person1,"But we can certainly get to the our objectives organically.
"
Person1,"The nature of the beast here, <UNK>, and you ask a good question.
"
Person1,"And this applies to residential products as well as commercial.
"
Person1,"Generally speaking when you are selling a higher priced product, let's say when you're selling a variable speed pump versus a single speed pump and that goes with a higher price, generally speaking the higher the price of the item, the lower the margin percent.
"
Person1,"Again, and I can point to the margin percent and margin dol<UNK>rs.
"
Person1,"So much the same applies.
"
Person1,"So when we are selling equipment for example to commercial customers and you're talking about <UNK>rger filters and <UNK>rger pumps, that is sold at lower margin percent than when we are selling a residential sized pump and filter.
"
Person1,"Certain product categories, I'll call it accessories which are lower dol<UNK>r items, the cost to serve from a percentage of sales price standpoint higher tend to have higher margin percents.
"
Person1,"And that applies to commercial as well as residential and that applies also to parts, residential and commercial.
"
Person0,"When you're talking about tax dol<UNK>rs deferred, I think you're talking about the long discussion that I had on the -- oh, I'm sorry, you're talking about the tax payment dol<UNK>rs.
"
Person0,"That was about $37 million was our expected cash tax payment in the third quarter which will be made in the fourth quarter instead.
"
Person0,"$37 million, yeah.
"
Person1,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Thank you, William and thank you all for listening.
"
Person1,"I think we set a record in terms of time and I appreciate everyone's questions.
"
Person1,"I apologize for sometimes rambling on too long but hopefully gave you color where appropriate.
"
Person1,"Our next conference call is scheduled for February 16 in 2017 when we will discuss our final 2016 results.
"
Person1,"Thank you again and have a great day.
"
