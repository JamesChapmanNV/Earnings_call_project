Person1,"Thank you, WIlliam.
"
Person1,"Well, we closed the vast majority of those stores after the wedding season, so they were essentially closed in the third quarter.
"
Person1,"So the transfer is really a 2017 event.
"
Person1,"Historically we have seen a very high transfer rate in the Men's Wearhouse stores.
"
Person1,"And we will continue to monitor.
"
Person1,"You know, we had a pretty strong tux year.
"
Person1,"So it is hard to see that they had a material impact on us.
"
Person1,"I mean obviously we are pretty dominant in the tux rental space, so to a certain degree, anybody that rents a tux is taking a little bit of share from us.
"
Person1,"But we had another good year in tux, so I do not see the material impact.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"We think that might be playing a role and we think we feel that probably the most at K&G.
"
Person2,"And we have seen some traffic improvements in the last week or so that we attribute that.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"I mean, we are going to be investing a little bit in some of our store remodels.
"
Person2,"Our Joseph Bank fleet is going to be getting some, what I would say is some sort of paint and carpet kind of investment because those stores have not been touched in a while and we want to make sure that we maintain the experience that our customer expects.
"
Person2,"In addition to that, we've got our IT spending, we have got some of the spending on things that <UNK> talked about, particular in omni.
"
Person2,"And then there are some miscellaneous things around facilities and things like that, but we think $90 million is an appropriate amount.
"
Person2,"That is down from last year in part because in 2016 we made some DC investments that won't repeat in 2017.
"
Person2,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to updating you on our next quarter.
"
