Person0,"The minerals, it is difficult to model the top line, there is no sense trying to model what commodity prices are going to do.
"
Person0,"The bottom line is, we expect that business to be a solid, steady, growing contributor.
"
Person0,"We have said before that it is tied to animal numbers in the US, and so it is a low single-digit type of growth business and we would expect our EBITDA to continue to grow in that kind of a range, with maybe a little bit of upside as we get efficiencies and some leverage on some of our expenses.
"
Person0,"That is how you think about that, from a modeling point of view.
"
Person1,"Yes, you can -- I don't even have the number off the top of my head, but I think we say our animal health segment is about 45% in the US, yes it's 45% across the entire segment.

"
Person1,"These products are not affected by people saying -- their requests for antibiotics.
"
Person1,"Antibiotics is a defined term.
"
Person1,"And most of the industry, if you read through most of the producers, I would say the trend is to try to focus on what is medically important, and yet to use a range of other products, including some antibiotics, in order to treat coccidial diseases and all of the diseases that these animals have, and there is no other way to do that.
"

Person1,"That is how we got to the Magni-Phi product line, and we continue to look.
"
Person1,"This is not a simple task at all, we are dealing with lots of conditions, cocci, bacteria, viruses, a whole range of things that go on in an animal that need to be dealt with.
"
Person1,"And remembering that the chicken lives for 4 to 5 weeks, and they don't have a long time to treat the animal before it gets slaughtered, so we're not going to see a huge, huge shift away from what is necessary to raise animals.

"
Person0,"MVP was a small part of the dollar increase.

Person0,"What we've talked about is pricing pressure in some international markets, and Brazil is an important market for us, and so with the Brazil currency strengthening back a bit from where it had been, that takes a little bit of the pricing pressure off and makes it a little easier for us, for our customer to make the sale and take some volumes.

Person0,"Okay everyone, we will come back to you and we'll be talking about our full-year results when we release them, probably in -- we haven't announced it yet, but it will either be late August or early September we'll be putting out our fiscal year results so, talk then.
