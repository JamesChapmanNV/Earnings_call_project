Person0,"I'll give you a general on the pipe.
"
Person0,"Every year we always say that we have such scale that will I be sitting here in a year from now here telling you that I had 22,000 23,000 shows.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"We have no fear that our global staff - were the best at it.
"
Person0,"We will continue to get our share of the market and slightly more.
"
Person0,"Last year we had an exceptional, in the US only, an exceptional stadium year, had a lot of big stadium tours out last year.
"
Person0,"We don't see that repeating this year.
"
Person0,"But we are already seeing a much stronger arenas business this year, because the artists have decided maybe I'm not going to go in stadiums, but I'll do longer -- US states will come to life.
"
Person0,"I think you'll also see some artists debate whether with the FX cost and the cost of business if they do a few more shows in America versus traveling overseas.
"
Person0,"So we would look at the pipe, it will be consistent from a show count, total ticket number year over year.
"
Person0,"We see it still being, given again it was a record year this year, which beat a record year the year before, so the benchmark continually gets higher.
"
Person0,"But we think we will repeat history.
"
Person0,"We think we'll have a strong arena market this year.

"
Person0,"We'll continue to launch a few more of those on a global basis this year.
"
Person0,"And we continue to think EDM is a great channel to be in the portfolio and is providing some great advertising sponsorship opportunities.
"
Person0,"As well as in 2015, it's the first year we'll officially move Insomniac all over to the Ticketmaster platform.
"
Person0,"As we start to get the double benefit of feeding the ticketing and advertising pipe.
"
Person0,"No, I would characterize it as I think it is a strong, stable global business.
"
Person0,"But the reality of EDM is when you're not hitting mainline arenas, stadiums, and festivals, like country, rock and roll, pop, and urban, it is always going to be a small percent of our total business.
"
Person0,"Because it is more about 10 great festivals of summer that matter versus 4,000 shows that happen across America that matter.
"
Person0,"So great small niche business, but given it operates outside of the traditional venue platform, it will always be more eventism and smaller to the total business.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
