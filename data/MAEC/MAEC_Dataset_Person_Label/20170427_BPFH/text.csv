"
Person1,"Morning.
"
Person1,"Thank you all for joining our call this morning.
"
Person1,"In the first quarter, our company generated net income of $15.7 million or $0.17 per share.
"
Person1,"This compares with $0.19 per share last quarter and $0.21 per share of the first quarter of 2016.
"
Person1,"Return on average tangible common equity was 11.4% for the quarter, and return on average common equity was 8.3%.
"
Person1,"These return levels are below our targets.
"
Person1,"I'd like to briefly touch on the factors influencing the quarter.
"
Person1,"Starting on the positive side, our primary goal in early 2017 was to frontload the year with strong growth across all of our businesses.
"
Person1,"To this end, in the quarter, we delivered strong growth in all of our key revenue-driving businesses, including mortgage loans, commercial loans, deposits and assets under management in all of our segments.
"
Person1,"Second, we saw expansion of our core net interest margin due to our balance sheet positioning and our core deposit strength.
"
Person1,"The combination of strong balance sheet growth and net interest margin expansion translated into 16% annualized growth in net interest income in the quarter.
"
Person1,"And finally, Boston Private Wealth continues to demonstrate client appeal and stability while posting positive AUM flows, allowing us to now shift our management focus to improving profitability and growth.
"
Person1,"At the same time, our quarterly profitability was below our long-term target and our shareholders' expectations.
"
Person1,"We were short on revenues, primarily due to lower levels of swap fee income in the quarter.
"
Person1,"At the same time, our operating expenses were elevated during the quarter due to seasonal compensation expenses and by investments we have made in our franchise to increase long-term earnings strength.
"
Person1,"Specifically, we have added client-facing business development staff to increase the growth of our client base across our markets and we have begun spending on a 3-year technology infrastructure plan to deliver a better client experience, make our client-facing professionals more productive and realize cost efficiencies.
"
Person1,"We expect that these expenditures will help our company improve its competitiveness and drive earnings growth.
"
Person1,"Despite these expenditures in the quarter, we expect to deliver on our performance targets for the remainder of the year.
"
Person1,"The Boston Private management team and I continue to be excited about opportunities to build growth and earnings strength as the year progresses.
"
Person1,"With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave, and we'll walk through the details.
"
Person1,"Dave.
"
Person2,"Thanks, Clay.
"
Person2,"Good morning, everyone.
"
Person2,"My comments will begin with Slide 3, which provides a summary of our key performance metrics.
"
Person2,"As Clay mentioned, our return on average common equity for the first quarter of 2017 was 8.3%, and that declined both on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis.
"
Person2,"Our Tier 1 common equity ratio of 10% remains at the top end of our target range.
"
Person2,"And notably, total AUM is up 4% linked quarter, driven by both positive net flows and investment performance.
"
Person2,"It's also up 7% on a year-over-year basis.
"
Person2,"Slide 4 shows consolidated revenue trends.
"
Person2,"Our primary source of revenue, which is net interest income, increased 4% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year to $53.6 million.
"
Person2,"Total core fees and income decreased 6% linked quarter and 4% year-over-year to $36.3 million.
"
Person2,"The primary driver of the decreased core fees and income is lower swap fee income that Clay mentioned, and that declined 70% linked quarter and more than 80% year-over-year due to lower client demand.
"
Person2,"Another factor contributing to lower core fees and income linked quarter is that we received $1.4 million of performance fees in the fourth quarter of 2016, and that didn't repeat in the first quarter.
"
Person2,"Total other income declined, primarily due to the positive impact of $5.1 million of items during the fourth quarter of 2016 that included the net gain on sale and a market value adjustment of the derivatives.
"
Person2,"The net gain on sale was attributable to the divestiture of 2 offices in Southern California that represented just over $100 million of deposits.
"
Person2,"On Slide 5, we show a detailed breakout of our consolidated operating -- our consolidated expenses.
"
Person2,"First quarter operating expenses decreased 4% linked quarter to $68.8 million and increased 3% year-over-year.
"
Person2,"Our first quarter compensation expenses always include seasonal items such as FICA and 401(k), so year-over-year is a more relevant comparison.
"
Person2,"On a year-over-year basis, our total operating expenses are up 3%, or if you exclude the restructuring charge in Q1 of '16, it was up 5%.
"
Person2,"Compensation expense is the primary driver of increased expense levels during the quarter.
"
Person2,"This quarter's elevated expenses also include staff additions due to strategic hires, and we incurred higher expense levels due to a change in our vacation policy, which is intended to reduce future expenses.
"
Person2,"Occupancy and professional services expenses also increased, and that was the cause -- as a result of technology investment we're making in order to improve the client experience.
"
Person2,"On Slide 6, we show the full consolidated income statement.
"
Person2,"Total net income was $15.7 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year.
"
Person2,"However, our pretax preprovision income was up 1% year-over-year.
"
Person2,"Slide 7 provides details on our asset quality.
"
Person2,"You can see the top chart shows the relationship between our net charge-offs or recoveries and our provision for loan loss.
"
Person2,"This quarter's $200,000 provision credit was driven by net recoveries and declining loss factors, partially offset by an increase in loan volume and an increase in criticized loans.
"
Person2,"The chart below highlights the bank's asset quality for the quarter.
"
Person2,"Criticized loans increased 14% linked quarter, but they remain 19% below last year.
"
Person2,"We continue to maintain strong reserves with our ALLL to loans finishing the quarter at 125 basis points.
"
Person2,"On Slide 8, we show the Private Banking segment which excludes the Wealth Management & Trust portion of our bank.
"
Person2,"Here, net interest income increased 4% linked quarter due to loan and deposit growth, coupled with core NIM expansion.
"
Person2,"Total other income decreased linked quarter due to the previously mentioned gain on office sale and other items.
"
Person2,"Our total operating expenses here increased 12% both linked quarter and year-over-year to $35.1 million, and that was driven by the compensation expenses noted earlier.
"
Person2,"Slide 9 shows the past 5 quarters of average loan balances and deposit balances by type.
"
Person2,"Total average loans for the quarter increased 10% year-over-year.
"
Person2,"The growth rates of the individual loan categories on the accompanying slide were affected by reclassifications we made at the end of last year.
"
Person2,"This reclassification moved some tax-exempt loans that are primarily multifamily loans from CRE -- sorry, from C&I to CRE.
"
Person2,"If we would have applied the reclassification to prior periods, CRE growth would have been approximately 3% linked quarter and 12% year-over-year, while C&I growth would have been approximately 4% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year.
"
Person2,"Average total deposits for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year to $6.3 billion, and that was led by a growth in core funding.
"
Person2,"Noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts increased 14% year-over-year, and that was followed by the savings accounts and money markets at 5% and CDs at 2%.
"
Person2,"As you may remember, we divested just over $100 million of deposits as part of the sale of the 2 offices in Southern California, and this is the first full quarter where the divested deposits do not show up in the average deposit figures.
"
Person2,"Turning to Slide 10.
"
Person2,"Core bank net interest income increased to $54.0 million, and net interest margin at the bank increased 7 basis points linked quarter to 2.98%.
"
Person2,"Excluding interest recovered on previous nonaccrual loans, our core net interest margin increased 8 basis points to [2.97%].
"
Person2,"NIM expansion was primarily driven by increased yield on loans, which expanded from [3 51] to [3 61] during the quarter.
"
Person2,"The bank's all-in cost of funds increased just 2 basis points, that's partially due to some increased brokered CDs that we took to optimize borrowing costs.
"
Person2,"With that, I'll turn it over to <UNK> <UNK>, CEO of Boston Private Wealth.
"
Person2,"<UNK>.
"
Person3,"Thanks, Dave.
"
Person3,"Slide 11 contains financial information for the Wealth Management & Trust segment, which operates under the Boston Private Wealth brand.
"
Person3,"Total revenue decreased 2% linked quarter to $10.9 million.
"
Person3,"Overall, AUM increased from $7 billion to $7.3 billion for the quarter.
"
Person3,"Due to a lag in how we bill AUM, higher AUM balances will impact the second quarter core revenues.
"
Person3,"Adjusted expenses, excluding last quarter's goodwill impairment charge increased 3% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonal compensation expense.
"
Person3,"When comparing the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017, you will see that on an annualized run rate basis, we have already taken out nearly $4 million of operating expense.
"
Person3,"As a result, year-over-year, adjusted expenses have decreased 6%.
"
Person3,"Segment EBITDA, excluding adjustments, decreased $700,000 linked quarter, while it has increased $800,000 year-over-year.
"
Person3,"Turning to Slide 12, we show both new business flows and net flows at Boston Private Wealth for the past 8 quarters.
"
Person3,"New business flows moderated to $120 million.
"
Person3,"Client attrition reached the lowest levels in the last 8 quarters resulting in positive net flows of $34 million.
"
Person3,"We remain focused on demonstrating continued stability at Boston Private Wealth as we move towards positioning the company for profitability and growth.
"
Person3,"I'll now hand it back to Clay.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Let me now touch on our other wealth businesses.
"
Person1,"Slide 13 will show you AUM net flows by segment.
"
Person1,"The Investment Management segment showed net flows of negative $30 million.
"
Person1,"The Wealth Advisory segment showed net positive flows of $263 million.
"
Person1,"On a consolidated basis all-in, the company's net flows were positive $267 million.
"
Person1,"On Slide 14, we show that total revenue for the Investment Management segment decreased 13% linked quarter, while increasing 2% year-over-year.
"
Person1,"Excluding fourth quarter 2016 performance fees, linked quarter revenue was down 1%.
"
Person1,"Operating expenses decreased 7% linked quarter due to compensation expense from the fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"The Investment Management segment first quarter 2017 segment EBITDA margin of 30% is right in line with our 30% corporate target.
"
Person1,"Moving to Slide 15.
"
Person1,"Our Wealth Advisors reported revenues of $12.9 million, up 2% linked quarter and 1% year-over-year.
"
Person1,"The linked quarter operating expenses comparison was affected by the revaluation of a retirement liability in the fourth quarter.
"
Person1,"On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses are down 3% year-over-year.
"
Person1,"First quarter 2017 segment EBITDA margins are 29%, just below our corporate target of 30%.
"
Person1,"That concludes our comments on the quarter.
"
Person1,"We'll now open the line up for your questions.
"
Person4,"Dave, I wanted to dig in on the NIM.
"
Person4,"The asset sensitivity really, I thought surprised nicely this quarter.
"
Person4,"Specifically, the loan yields, interesting enough like everything, but C&I went up.
"
Person4,"So can you just give us some help on where the floating rate loans are on the loans side.
"
Person4,"And then, the deposit betas have been excellent.
"
Person4,"Are -- can you sustain that going forward.
"
Person4,"And just some overall help on the NIM outlook.
"
Person2,"Well first off, on the individual loan categories, you mentioned a declining C&I yield which looked odd.
"
Person2,"And it was a -- that was partially influenced by that reclassification that I talked about.
"
Person2,"So when we moved some of these industrial revenue bonds from the C&I to the CRE, those were fixed rate obligations and those were generally higher-yielding.
"
Person2,"So that caused a -- the decline primarily in the yield for C&I.
"
Person2,"We have floating rates in both the commercial and industrial and the commercial real estate, I would say, is our -- the bulk of the variable rate.
"
Person2,"Our residential mortgages will adjust over time, but those are primarily [5 1], [7 1] (inaudible), and it will take time for those to reset.
"
Person2,"On the deposit betas, yes, it has been great.
"
Person2,"And I think that wasn't unexpected given where we're at in this point of the rate cycle.
"
Person2,"I think most banks are really lagging and not showing much increase at this point.
"
Person2,"That won't happen as -- if rates continue to rise, we would expect there will be more pressure on the deposit side.
"
Person2,"But going forward, we could see further NIM expansion of 3 to 4 basis points throughout the rest of the year.
"
Person4,"Okay, great.
"
Person4,"That's helpful.
"
Person4,"On switching to expenses, can you just quantify what the payroll tax impact was and then the vacation policy.
"
Person4,"And I believe you are targeting 3% to 4% expense growth on the tech investments.
"
Person4,"Is that still good for 2017.
"
Person4,"Okay, great.
"
Person4,"And just last one for <UNK> and Clay.
"
Person4,"On the Wealth Management, obviously, you finally turned the corner on the flow front.
"
Person4,"Is this a year that we hit -- we turn the corner on EBITDA margins turning positive.
"
Person3,"So and I guess best way to answer that question, maybe go backwards a little bit.
"
Person3,"With the departures in 2015, we lost about $12 million in revenue.
"
Person3,"Since then, we've been balancing rightsizing the cost structure while investing for growth.
"
Person3,"So we're building the business for the long-term and our goal is to be profitable this year, but we don't want to overreach and focus too much on costs.
"
Person3,"Certainly got off to a good start in the first quarter though.
"
Person1,"Short answer to those, yes.
"
Person1,"We intend to generate positive margins this year.
"
Person1,"And <UNK> and his team are very hard at work on that.
"
Person1,"Because of the nature of balancing that out, we're not telegraphing an end of year run rate, but we are committed to positive margins this year in the business.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"Well, it continued to be a focus of our actively looking for opportunities like that.
"
Person2,"We feel confident that we could achieve some of those this year.
"
Person2,"There was none of that in this quarter.
"
Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I mean that was kind of a point in time in terms of ring fencing certain group of individuals that had gone through, maybe a lot of turnover or had to had significant changes in their client service team.
"
Person1,"We do think we're beyond that.
"
Person1,"Having said that, we think we have to earn the business every day, so we're constantly monitoring all of our clients to make sure we're meeting our service level agreements.
"
Person2,"Over the balance of the year.
"
Person2,"No, that was immaterial impact.
"
Person2,"No, I think we're looking for deposit growth to facilitate that, Chris.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Yes, Chris, we'd like to keep a pretty similar liquidity profile to what we have baseline, year before.
"
Person2,"Yes, Chris, that's always a tough one to predict.
"
Person2,"We'll probably see some recoveries in the coming quarters.
"
Person2,"But again, it would be hard for me to project beyond year-end and say, okay, it's going to continue into '18.
"
Person2,"But I think in -- over the course of the second half or the remainder of 2017, yes, we'll see some recoveries.
"
Person2,"No.
"
Person2,"I think that when you looked at the early stage buckets, the [30] to [89] past due was up.
"
Person2,"It was driven primarily -- there was one $9 million loan that was in negotiations and so they had stopped the payment, but it's subsequently paid off in early April.
"
Person2,"And in the special mention categories, we had 2 loans probably totaling about $15 million, one on the East Coast, one on the West Coast, that were downgraded from past to special mention.
"
Person2,"It was a result of upcoming lease renewals.
"
Person2,"And I think in one case, there was a -- a tenant had left and they're negotiating with new tenants.
"
Person2,"So just moved into the watch list.
"
Person2,"We want to make sure we're out ahead of things and raising issues where we see that we need attention.
"
Person1,"Just so I get it, Chris.
"
Person1,"You're talking about in the affiliates or including the wealth business.
"
Person1,"Or how would you like me to.
"
Person1,".
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"It's really the 3 buckets of fees in the overall fiduciary piece in terms of just looking of those relative to AUM on an average basis, those percentages seemed to come down first quarter.
"
Person1,"So I was curious if we go back to where they were or if there is a net improvement year-over-year.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Hard to say.
"
Person1,"I mean the only thing I have some confidence in, Chris.
"
Person1,"The positive flows in the first quarter will help us a bit with second quarter revenue.
"
Person1,"There is usually a following quarter effect because of the way we bill.
"
Person1,"So there is a little bit of updraft most likely.
"
Person1,"Our investment managers face pricing pressure in the platform business, yet the pricing drip down has been very measured of late.
"
Person1,"So I would be hopeful we'd get some revenue expansion and investment management net.
"
Person1,"And I don't see any weird thing coming on their expense side.
"
Person1,"So hopefully, we'll get stable to improving margins there.
"
Person1,"The 2 Wealth Advisors doing a really good job had positive flows in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"Those businesses tend to have pretty stable economics.
"
Person1,"They're enjoying fee stability.
"
Person1,"And again, I don't see any unusual cost structure thing coming at us.
"
Person1,"Their cost structure is driven almost totally by staffing.
"
Person1,"And then <UNK> has already addressed his business.
"
Person1,"We like where it sits today and we're working on client attraction, revenue build and margin improvement.
"
Person1,"So I guess when I net it all out, I sure as heck don't foresee margin degradation.
"
Person1,"And I think we'll go sideways to potentially improving.
"
Person1,"Well, again, given our small size, I don't think it's a market limit.
"
Person1,"We're serving really deep pools of attractive clients on both coasts.
"
Person1,"So the mitigants are more self-imposed financial limits driven by maintaining liquidity.
"
Person1,"So I think our ability to keep pace on deposit build while maintaining our target capital levels is how we get to, in effect, the resulting growth rate.
"
Person1,"We like balance sheet expansion in this rate environment.
"
Person1,"And I think the anatomy of our NII development this quarter kind of validates that.
"
Person1,"So I like what we're doing.
"
Person1,"From a risk standpoint though, I don't think you'll ever wake up one morning and see us heating up the balance sheet 15%, 18%, 20%, that's kind of not us.
"
Person1,"So that's -- does that address it clearly.
"
Person1,"But we think the floating from 7% to 8% up to more like 8% to 10% is really doing good things for the revenue build.
"
Person1,"Well, <UNK> and I talk a lot and I talk a lot with our affiliates.
"
Person1,"They're -- we're always, to some extent, affected by macro shocks, and that's kind of in the who knows category.
"
Person1,"But a big macro shock does expose us to market action.
"
Person1,"Now separately, flows, flows are fundamentally about client behavior and about our ability to maintain client appeal.
"
Person1,"So that's kind of on us.
"
Person1,"I do think flows tend to come perhaps a little more readily in a rally.
"
Person1,"They're a little more dear in a big selldown, but that's kind of how we parse it.
"
Person1,"We're always thinking about macro effects that drives market action that has big effect on our portfolios.
"
Person1,"And we've told you in the past that our portfolios have about a 50% beta relative to market action.
"
Person1,"So if U.S. equity markets are plus 10, we're kind of blended -- we're quite often up 5.
"
Person1,"If markets are down 5, we'd be down half of that sort of thing.
"
Person1,"But that's how we parse it.
"
Person1,"Macro events, market action, and then client behavior and what we're doing in terms of client attraction and client development.
"
Person1,"We're excited about the remainder of the year as you [glean] from my comments.
"
Person1,"I like the growth profile in the first quarter.
"
Person1,"I'm not happy with the profitability, but we understand the expense dynamics and we're sticking with what we're doing and standing by our commitments.
"
Person1,"Thanks everybody for listening in, and we look forward to more conversation.
"
