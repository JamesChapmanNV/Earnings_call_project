Person0,"So we expect to introduce this, as we mentioned, in the fourth quarter.
"
Person0,"And it will be supported appropriately, to make sure the consumers know that we now have this with the Movado brand.
"
Person0,"And it will be within not only the design aesthetics of the brand, but also within the price points that our consumers expect for the Movado brand.

Person2,"That and our cost reductions.
"
Person1,"It was mixed pricing and our sourcing improvements, correct.
"
Person1,"Obviously, that was when -- a year -- at last year end when we were looking forward into this year.
"
Person1,"That was our estimate of what the impact would be, and because of that, we did things like the price increases and took other actions.
"
Person1,"So our guidance does reflect all the actions that we're taking to react to what is now the new reality of currency.
"
Person2,"Okay.
"
Person2,"I would like to thank all of you for participating on today's call.
"
Person2,"And we'll obviously update you again in our third quarter call, and wish everybody a very happy end to the summer.
"
Person2,"Okay, thank you very much.
