Person0,"Sure, we actually added a table in our press release at the very end of the schedules.
"
Person0,"That's okay.
"
Person0,"I can't comment on what the competitors have done and our press release has been updated and not any significant developments during the quarter.
"
Person0,"So that's about all I can say about that.
"
Person0,"We have a great team that delivers great results as evidenced by the press release, and so I sleep pretty well most nights I got to tell you.
"
Person0,"There's always challenges, always opportunities, and so we look forward to seizing those and taking advantage of those as we move forward.
"
Person0,"So that'll always continue to be our approach.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"So the effects of the euro on revenue for the quarter was about $250 million.
"
Person0,"So you add that back to the equation, and part of it is a little bit larger mix of the light-duty trucks, the model LF compared to the CFXF mix during the first half of last year.
"
Person0,"No, just customer demand.
"
Person0,"All the trucks are great and the LF is particularly popular in the UK and very well received by customers and that market has grown a little faster than the rest of Europe, reflecting their economic growth.
"
Person0,"And so we're seeing some benefits from that phenomenon.
"
Person0,"I think as <UNK> said, we've gotten the benefits of operating leverage and that should continue.
"
Person0,"Obviously freight rates are dependent a lot on diesel prices and so that will go up or down as diesel prices move.
"
Person0,"But again, our team has done a good job of transitioning to PACCAR branded components and with our newest designs, we have a higher element of proprietary content.
"
Person0,"So I think we're in good shape and positioned well and shouldn't see significant movements from where we're at currently.
"
Person0,"So we continue to be a pretty small player in that market.
"
Person0,"Our team is doing great.
"
Person0,"The factory is running very well, the quality of the product is excellent and very well received by the customers.
"
Person0,"Our dealers continue to invest in their facilities to fully represent the DAF brand in the market.
"
Person0,"The market this year will be down substantially probably in the 45,000 to 55,000 truck range.
"
Person0,"South America total probably 70,000 to 80,000 trucks for the year.
"
Person0,"But we have a great team and a great long-term perspective on building our business and it will be a bigger and bigger contributor to PACCAR's results over time.
"
Person0,"No we opened and expand distribution centers on an ongoing basis and it's just part of continuing to support that growing Parts business.
"
Person0,"And our dealers needs to have same-day delivery to meet their needs.
"
Person0,"So I don't -- there won't be any margin impact as a result of that transition.
"
Person0,"I think we'll continue to see that grow.
"
Person0,"The more and more customers that a lot of times they'll start with some level if they're a larger fleet.
"
Person0,"And as they get experience, most will often increase their percentage penetration in their fleet with the MX engine.
"
Person0,"So we expect that to continue to grow 50% to 60% over time.
"
Person0,"It certainly has -- the engine has the capability to meet about 80% of our customers needs.
"
Person0,"So we're very excited about the potential for that as we progress over the next three, five years.
"
Person0,"I think over time.
"
Person0,"We install PACCAR engines, branded engines, purchased from Cummins for our medium duty product.
"
Person0,"It's always a possibility but nothing on the short-term horizon for us in that area.
"
Person0,"Typically hasn't been our approach.
"
Person0,"We have a great engine to support our product and we can -- got the capacity to support future growth.
"
Person0,"But selling to other OEMs is not an avenue that we've thought about pursuing.
"
Person0,"Yes, it's possible but really not part of our thought process at this time.
"
Person0,"I would like to thank everyone for their excellent questions and thank you, Operator.
