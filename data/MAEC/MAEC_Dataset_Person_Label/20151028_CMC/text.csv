Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"There are lots of different incentives offered to us by the state.
"
Person0,"That's one of the reasons why we located in Oklahoma.
"
Person0,"Rather than getting into all of the details, I'll let them keep reporting on it.
"
Person0,"They can work through the paperwork.
"
Person0,"To me that's not useful good use of time for us.

"
Person0,"So to try to make a living off of a subsidized source, while it might have short-term benefit and impact, long term really isn't a viable strategy.
"
Person0,"Okay.
"
Person0,"Thanks, Chuck.
"
Person0,"Well, thank you, I appreciate that.
"
Person0,"Thank you all for joining us on today's conference call.

"
Person0,"Thanks, all, and have a good day.
