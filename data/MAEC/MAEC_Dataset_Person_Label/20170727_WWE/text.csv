Person1,"Good morning, everyone.
"
Person1,"We are pleased with execution of our strategy to optimize our long-term value of our content.
"
Person1,"<UNK>s you know, revenue increased 8% to a quarterly record of $215 million.
"
Person1,"<UNK>nd we delivered our earnings results pretty much essentially in line with our guidance.
"
Person1,"Live event revenue increased to quarterly record of $53 million, which I think is notable.
"
Person1,"We are reaching 85 million year-to-date with our global attendance up about 100,000.
"
Person1,"The Network segment reached a quarterly record of $55 million as our WWE network paid subscribers increased 8%.
"
Person1,"Similar interesting things that we've got on as well is -- there's something called the Mae Young Classic named after one of our more extraordinary female performers of the past.
"
Person1,"It's one of things that Paul Levesque is putting together for us as he did the Cruiserweight and, of course, all the young individuals who are scheduled to one-day compete for us down at the Performance Center.
"
Person1,"The Mae Young Classic is really an opportunity to bring up young female performers, which is very -- is vital actually to our overall product, many of the quarter hours you see in television reflect our women superstars.
"
Person1,"So this is an opportunity, obviously, to grow that base, which we haven't done all that well in the past.
"
Person1,"Overall, one of the things that I look at as one of my barometers is the overall interest in the product.
"
Person1,"<UNK>nd for the first 6 months of the year, our digital video views reached 9.1 billion, which is pretty much extraordinary.
"
Person1,"It's up 18%.
"
Person1,"Our social media followers continue -- certainly surpassed the 800 million, which again I think is a tremendous indication in the overall interest in our product.
"
Person1,"That's always been one of my big barometers.
"
Person1,"Global sponsorship looked pretty good.
"
Person1,"Its revenue grew up -- grew about 25%.
"
Person1,"Some of the more blue-chip advertisers have joined us, KFC, Nestl\xe9, <UNK>T&T and some gaming partners as well.
"
Person1,"We have selected Lagard\xe8re in terms of our best-in-class marketing agency to help us develop our global sponsorship business.
"
Person1,"Other notable things going on, we have a live event in Shenzhen over in China on September 17, which is going well and just part of our strategy in China, which looks good to-date.
"
Person1,"<UNK>nd we localized some of our weekly television shows, which is working out well for us in India and in the Middle East.
"
Person1,"We will probably continue to do more of that going forward in other markets.
"
Person1,"When we speak of other markets, we completed a multi-year agreement to televise Raw and SmackDown on SuperSport, which is definitely the way to go, that's <UNK>frica's premier sports broadcaster.
"
Person1,"Those are some of the things that we've got going on among others.
"
Person0,"Thank you, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, we are ready now.
"
Person0,"Please open the lines for questions.
"
Person0,"Thank you, everyone.
"
Person0,"We appreciate you listening to the call today.
"
Person0,"If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
