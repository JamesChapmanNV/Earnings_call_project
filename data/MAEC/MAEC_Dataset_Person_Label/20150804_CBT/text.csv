Person1,"I'm going to ask <UNK> to take that question.
"
Person2,"Yes, I would say it's probably going to be in that range, <UNK>, based on when currency started to move last year.
"
Person2,"So you're talking about the fourth quarter now, <UNK>.
"
Person2,"I would say it's probably a similar impact based on when rates really started to move last year, which I think was at the end of September, and going into October.
"
Person2,"So probably in that range, depending on how, quite frankly, rates evolve between now and then, and specific rates.
"
Person1,"Yes, I would be happy to do so.
"
Person1,"And so this is the EPA action on the carbon black industry in the US.
"
Person1,"And we -- as you may remember, we entered into a consent decree last year.
"
Person1,"And as a result of that, decided that, because of the capital imposition that this consent decree required on us, we would have to apply an environmental surcharge starting in 2015.
"
Person1,"We have been implementing this surcharge.
"
Person1,"Of course, the success of the surcharge, and the reaction from the customers, is dependent on the whole industry proceeding with us.
"
Person1,"And we were pleased recently, a few weeks ago, to hear that one of our competitors had actually entered into the second consent decree.
"
Person1,"And we are also hearing that all the other players are engaged with the EPA, and hope that we will see the complete industry having adopted and agreed with the EPA on a path forward, in the coming months.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Thank you very much, and I thank everyone for joining us today.
"
Person1,"And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
