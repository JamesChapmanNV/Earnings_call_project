Person0,"Well first of all, when you look at our hedge book for 2017, according to consensus, its close to 50% of our expected production.
"
Person0,"Maybe on a six rig program, a little less than that.
"
Person0,"And that's at $3.08.
"
Person0,"You know with that base wedge of hedges in place, <UNK>, I think it's unlikely that we would look at anything less than a six rig scenario.
"
Person0,"We obviously think that later this year there's going to be an opportunity to layer in some additional hedges.
"
Person0,"Obviously as a Company, historically we've shown that we take as much risk off the table by having these solid hedge books, anywhere from 40% to 70% hedged.
"
Person0,"In fact, this year we're 82% to 85% hedged, just because of our bearish view on the commodity.
"
Person0,"But that being said, fundamentally we don't see anything that's going to cause gas prices to go down between now and the end of the year.
"
Person0,"And so I think our view is let's wait and layer in some more hedges when there begin to be some spikes in gas as we approach winter and get those first cold snaps.
"
Person0,"So again, I think unlikely we would be less than six rigs.
"
Person0,"With the hedge book we have started already and the ability to layer in additional hedges on top of that.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thank you, Audrey.
"
Person0,"We appreciate your time and interest today.
"
Person0,"Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to our investor relations team.
"
Person0,"This concludes our call.
