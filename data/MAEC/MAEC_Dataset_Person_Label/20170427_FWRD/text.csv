Person0,"Thank you, Julia, and good morning to everyone on the call.
"
Person0,"Before we move to Q&A, we would like to make a few remarks about our recently announced acquisition of Atlantic.
"
Person0,"As Julia mentioned, we're joined on the call today by Matt <UNK>, who oversees our Intermodal and Truckload businesses.
"
Person0,"Matt, let me turn it over to you to provide an overview of the transaction.
"
Person1,"Thanks, Mike.
"
Person1,"On April 10, we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary CST had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Atlantic Trucking Company.
"
Person1,"This transaction has been a few years in the making.
"
Person1,"Since acquiring CST in 2014, we've been actively looking for an intermodal company with the right mix of customers, locations, driver fleet and management expertise to serve our -- as our Southeast beachhead and we found that in Atlantic.
"
Person1,"Atlantic is headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, with 8 other locations, Savannah, Atlanta, Charlotte, Norfolk, Nashville, Jacksonville, Memphis and Houston.
"
Person1,"It has 416 drivers, 83 company and 333 independent contractors.
"
Person1,"It has a legacy leadership team that has all agreed to stay on, and has a great blend of liner, freight forwarder and BCO customers.
"
Person1,"To acquire Atlantic, Forward Air will pay $22.5 million, with the potential for a $1 million earn out.
"
Person1,"Assuming the earn out is achieved, the $23.5 million purchase price represents a 4.6x Atlantic's 2016 EBITD<UNK>
"
Person1,"We expect the transaction to close on or before May 15, and we're very excited to welcome Atlantic to the Forward Air family and I want to personally thank the entire CST team and Atlantic's owners, Kevin Gregg and Julie O'Donnell, for all of their hard work and helping us put this transaction together.
"
Person0,"Thanks, Matt.
"
Person0,"Matt will remain on the call this morning to address any questions about Atlantic or our Intermodal and Truckload businesses in general.
"
Person0,"Before we move to Q&A, I will mention that we expect Atlantic to be $0.02 to $0.03 accretive and provide roughly $2.5 million of EBITDA in 2017.
"
Person0,"So with that, Julia, let's open the line for Q&<UNK>
"
Person2,"The emphasis is we.
"
Person2,"I -- the quick answer is, Pool, even though they are suffering from a tough market today.
"
Person2,"The good side of that is their competitors are going out of business left and right.
"
Person2,"So we've been able to do a number of things that we haven't been able to do in the past.
"
Person2,"So for instance, we've been able to get through reasonable rate increases, we've been able to establish a really stable management team that is really doing a top-notch job led by Roger Gellis.
"
Person2,"So a lot of really positive things and the bottom line that's interesting to me because what everybody reads, that business is not doing that bad in terms of year-over-year business.
"
Person2,"So kind of the interesting year woe and everything is awful, but in reality it's okay.
"
Person0,"Yes, sure, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I'll start on the response to the 1Q tonnage and let <UNK> chime in.
"
Person0,"We were really tracking our forecast through the first 2.5 months in the quarter and we were surprisingly spot on.
"
Person0,"And then as we got into the back end of March, things accelerated and the LTL team did a great job taking advantage, driving the opportunity and then taking advantage of it from an operations perspective to bring the profit in to the bottom line.
"
Person0,"So it was really a second half of March acceleration.
"
Person0,"Looking to the second quarter, we've returned to normal April trends, so the acceleration in the second half of March is decelerated.
"
Person0,"And what we've got baked in for the full quarter is essentially flattish, flat tonnage on a year-over-year basis for the second quarter.
"
Person0,"Because right now given the trends and the overall sluggishness in the environment, we don't see a catalyst at this stage for Q2 to have a pickup in tonnage year-on-year.
"
Person2,"I'm not sure there was a specific, <UNK>, but it seemed like almost an old March, old meaning like 5, 6, 7 years ago.
"
Person2,"So it was great.
"
Person2,"It was wonderful to see.
"
Person2,"We're hopeful that it continues.
"
Person2,"We, however, stay on the sidelines in terms of, gee, it's going to be a boomer the rest of the year.
"
Person2,"Yield jumping all over the place or being driven all over the place.
"
Person2,"As opposed in the past were the criteria for yield was fairly stable, today it's not.
"
Person2,"So having said that, we're seeing a length of haul that's shortening.
"
Person2,"We're seeing shipment size that's getting just a little bit smaller.
"
Person2,"And then you have the Complete being thrown on top of it.
"
Person2,"So a lot of mixture going on there that we haven't had in the past.
"
Person2,"All that having been said, we're very happy with where yield is.
"
Person2,"We will, as we always do on an annual basis, come summer time we'll be looking at, do we need to do a GRI or not.
"
Person2,"We have a lot of work to do before we get there and we'll comment on that next quarter probably.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Sure, I'll take that, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"We didn't put Atlantic in because the transaction has yet to close.
"
Person0,"If we had put it in, it wouldn't have had a noticeable effect in all likelihood.
"
Person0,"Assuming a May 15 close, but we're in a short stub period, if it slips a week or whatever, you don't have a lot of opportunity for incremental contribution.
"
Person0,"So we decided to just leave it out for those reasons.
"
Person0,"If you do assume a mid-May close, then we would see it adding, as I mentioned, $0.02 to $0.03 for the balance so May 15 to December 31, for the balance of 2017, and again assuming a mid-May close of about $2.5 million of EBITDA for the balance of '17.
"
Person1,"Yes, sure.
"
Person1,"So we have very little exposure to the Southeast ports which have been the fastest growing in the last few years.
"
Person1,"So we're really needed, as I've described it a beachhead in the Southeast, to really generate access to those ports and those revenues.
"
Person1,"And frankly, we were a Midwest-based company with small presences in Savannah and Charleston and Houston.
"
Person1,"But this gives us access to all the Norfolk port which is growing very fast, Savannah which is growing extremely fast.
"
Person1,"They just announced an alliance between those 2 ports, Virginia and Georgia announced an alliance there to deal with the supersized ships that are coming in.
"
Person1,"Houston is growing.
"
Person1,"This gives us a bigger presence in Houston.
"
Person1,"And frankly, a lot of our Midwest customers have always asked, do we have a presence here, can we handle their business in these other induction points, and we couldn't.
"
Person1,"So not only is this going to position us for some really good organic growth in new markets, but it's also going to allow us to have a platform in which to bolt on other acquisitions in these new markets.
"
Person1,"So it's both an organic and an inorganic play and it just -- it takes us up to 19 locations now which is when we -- essentially, Atlantic is the same size as what CST was when we acquired it.
"
Person1,"So we've really done a, in terms of expanding on the footprint, expanding our opportunities both organically and inorganically, this is a huge play for us.
"
Person2,"The answer is yes.
"
Person2,"I think we have to keep in mind the perspective and the perspective is, Q1 was up over Q1 of a year ago, which was terrible.
"
Person2,"So it's nice to see.
"
Person2,"We're happy the business came on.
"
Person2,"We obviously got to participate in it.
"
Person2,"We're certainly not selling our company based on that.
"
Person2,"That's traction.
"
Person2,"We have a number of initiatives going on today in our air expedite group.
"
Person2,"The big one is our 3PL push.
"
Person2,"So we have entered that market, actually entered it a year ago.
"
Person2,"Had to do a lot of, what I call, back office work to get ready for it, to handle it properly.
"
Person2,"They have done a terrific job, and especially, as we have started 2017, they've really done a great job of penetrating that market.
"
Person2,"We look for a lot more to come.
"
Person2,"And all of that business for the most part, is related to Complete.
"
Person2,"So not only does it help our Linehaul product, but it also helps our Complete product.
"
Person2,"It depends on the situation.
"
Person2,"In most cases, you're right.
"
Person2,"But it's not -- to us, it's not meaningful because we look at that as incremental.
"
Person2,"We look at the Linehaul that it provides us purely incremental to our model.
"
Person2,"That we're actually looking at all of it.
"
Person2,"Yes, no pay pressure at the moment.
"
Person2,"We have been able to recruit.
"
Person2,"The TLX side of the world is a tough one to keep drivers happy.
"
Person2,"As opposed to the Air Expedite where they're running on their dedicated run.
"
Person2,"So we have a little bit more turnover there.
"
Person2,"But we have ramped up our efforts to make sure we have the right ratio.
"
Person2,"There is a good ratio there when you do have the opportunity to outsource.
"
Person2,"But you also want to make sure you can move, let's say, the majority of the freight on our trucks.
"
Person2,"I think that's very fair.
"
