Person0,"Yes, thanks for your question.
"
Person0,"We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business.
"
Person0,"It's growing very well.
"
Person0,"We like our position in it.
"
Person0,"We think our website is very, very atune to selling online.
"
Person0,"So we're very happy with that.
"
Person0,"It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally.
"
Person0,"So you mentioned a couple other consumables categories.
"
Person0,"I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard line categories as well.
"
Person0,"We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and subscribe and Save and others.
"
Person0,"So very happy with the EGM business as a whole.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Let me start with the first question on international media and EGM.
"
Person0,"I think we're seeing similar trends in both geographies, both segments that EGM growth is much -- is very strong.
"
Person0,"Media growth has been consistent for the last four quarters.
"
Person0,"We do like the work being done by the media teams.
"
Person0,"There's a lot of pipeline of invention, things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music, all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will.
"
Person0,"They work great with our devices, by the way.
"

Person0,"On transportation costs, not a lot to add there.
"
Person0,"Again, we are -- we have a combination of doing our own shipping and using third party carriers.
"
Person0,"So the rate increases are staged and we see those quite frequently, nothing to add there.
"
Person0,"On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we're looking to always to get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have.
"
Person0,"And as we need new facilities, we place them closer and closer to customers.
"
Person0,"So that can have its benefits as well.
"
Person0,"Not much more to add on that one.
