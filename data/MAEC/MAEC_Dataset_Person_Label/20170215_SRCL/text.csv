Person1,"Sure.
"
Person1,"I think if you think about our international footprint, there are some markets where we have secure information only businesses today, and there's some markets where we're in that we don't have any secure information, but we have certainly operational platforms there for medical waste.
"
Person1,"So one of the acquisitions we did internationally actually was in Spain.
"
Person1,"So we were able to acquire a leading secure information destruction business in Spain and then take our operational assets and help that business from a leverage standpoint, where we park our charts, using it now to sell secure information for the healthcare customers we have in that market, very similar to the United States and the Shred-it acquisition.
"
Person1,"Certainly, in markets where we currently have Shred-it assets, we add on acquisitions where we think we can get either tuck-in, so we'll do tuck-in acquisitions to leverage the existing secure information businesses that we have in those markets, or it might be an expansion of the geography where we're not currently in.
"
Person1,"So that's really how we're looking at secure information.
"
Person1,"Margins vary by geography.
"
Person1,"For the most part, if you look at Shred-it margins globally versus Shred-it margins in the US and Canada, they're very similar.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
"
Person1,"Thank you, Devon.
"
Person1,"Well, thank you, again for joining.
"
Person1,"We look forward to seeing some of you at various conferences and road shows in the coming months ahead.
"
Person1,"Have a great evening.
"
Person1,"Thanks so much.
