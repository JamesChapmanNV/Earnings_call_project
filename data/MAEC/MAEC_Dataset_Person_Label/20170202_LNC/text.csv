Person,Sentence
Person2,"Yes, <UNK>, I think of the year as almost perfectly in line with what I've said in the past, which is that this business is about $125 million a year business, or $500 million for a full year --
"
Person2,"Yes, excuse me.
"
Person2,"And if you think about the year, we made $550 million and that included $17 million positive unlocking.
"
Person2,"So right at that $125 million guidance.
"
Person2,"In terms of the quarter, the $154 million, we had strong variable investment income.
"
Person2,"That was largely offset, as I mentioned, by expenses.
"
Person2,"So at the end of the day, what you just had was mortality, really good mortality driving the $154 million of earnings; which, just coincidentally, was almost an exact mirror of the first quarter of the year.
"
Person2,"As I said in the first quarter of the year, about $20 million of expected seasonality.
"
Person2,"We had about $10 million of additional; total of $30 million this quarter.
"
Person2,"About $29 million of benefit overall, compared to an average quarter, from good, strong mortality which we expect to happen in that quarter of the year.
"
Person2,"It was strong across all areas.
"
Person2,"So the PE and hedge funds, I think as <UNK> might have mentioned in his script, the return was about 12% for the quarter.
"
Person2,"And we expect 10%, long term.
"
Person2,"So we had good, strong performance from the alts portfolio.
"
Person2,"And then, prepayment income was above what we've experienced over the last 4 to 5 years, and was over what I would expect over a much longer cycle.
"
Person2,"In total, it came up to about $13 million after tax, as I mentioned in my script.
"
Person2,"I would say that was fairly evenly split, maybe a little skewed towards prepayment income.
"
Person2,"If you broaden this out, and you think about alternatives and prepayment income over a longer cycle, and you look at the last couple of years, what you've seen is that alternatives in both of those years were a little below our long-term expectations.
"
Person2,"So for the full year, we were about $40 million lower than we would expect on the alternative side, whereas prepayment income was a little stronger.
"
Person2,"When you add them together, I don't think we are materially different from what a longer-term expectation might be for the sum of those two items.
"
Person1,"M&A is always a tool.
"
Person1,"And over the last 22 (laughter) 20 years or so, we've used it pretty effectively to really achieve what would otherwise would be our plan anyway.
"
Person1,"And so whenever we do M&A, it's because we're trying to accelerate a strategy; not to do it for the sake of doing it.
"
Person1,"You are correct; we have said that we have a longer-term strategy of increasing the percentage of our income that comes from mortality and morbidity; and that sort of in terms of our businesses, we would probably think the group business as the top priority.
"
Person1,"So, that's the strategy.
"
Person1,"Deals coming into market come episodically.
"
Person1,"We'll continue to look at things.
"
Person1,"We've looked at some properties in the last 24 months, and back to our allocating capital to the best use, it was way more expensive.
"
Person1,"Properties sold for way more than what we think would make sense for our use of capital.
"
Person1,"But it made a lot of good sense for the people who bought it.
"
Person1,"I don't know what their strategies were.
"
Person1,"So, prices would probably have to come down a little bit before we got real interested in a deal.
"
Person1,"But we'll keep looking.
"
Person1,"We are good at assessing M&A.
"
Person1,"We are good at integrating M&A.
"
Person1,"And if something comes along that fits with our long-term strategy, all of which points we have articulated, we would take a look.
"
Person1,"I will say that we wouldn't do anything that would materially affect our share buyback program over time.
"
Person1,"Maybe let's back up a little bit as I answer that question.
"
Person1,"We have, over the past four months, have had an internal team at Lincoln; the core team, eight or 10 people.
"
Person1,"We have had another 25 or 30 people from our outside consultant, and then we've involved overall probably another 100 people from Lincoln.
"
Person1,"And what we've spent our time doing is really trying to understand where the best opportunities are to both improve the customer experience -- I don't want to lose that concept -- improve the customer experience; and then as we are doing that, make sure that we find ways to finance that investment.
"
Person1,"And so the numbers that we are talking about are not just pulled out of the pocket.
"
Person1,"But they are the consequences of four months of pretty hard work and detail and math.
"
Person1,"Now, having said that, as we move into the execution, and repeating what <UNK> said, we're going to have to pay attention to short-term earnings as well as long-term opportunity.
"
Person1,"And the execution phase is very important.
"
Person1,"And I think it would be pretty premature to try to identify exactly what line of business is going to get the most benefit.
