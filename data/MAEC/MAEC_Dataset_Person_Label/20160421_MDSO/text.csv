Person,Sentence
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"Thanks, <UNK> for your question.
"
Person2,"On BI I think as it is typical for the large platform customers and it's a transformational type deal.
"
Person2,"And BI will adopt our platform and transition more and more of the current studies on to our platform.
"
Person2,"So is it 2017, 2018.
"
Person2,"I think our job is to make this deal bigger than it is actually contracted today.
"
Person2,"So it's hard to answer the question whether 2017 is the peak or 2018 or 2016.
"
Person2,"I think our job is to make that bigger of what it is today and it's growing over time.
"
Person2,"And as we innovate and give new solutions, we have opportunity to cross-sell.
"
Person2,"And I think that's the way to ensure that we can grow these deals even bigger and as to the 3x growth opportunity we have with those platform deals.
"
Person2,"As it relates to Intelemage, the business model is consumption based.
"
Person2,"So what the company's core business is to transact images and it's a transaction fee per image.
"
Person2,"And it enhances significantly our capabilities.
"
Person2,"It opens, it makes us more competitive in the area of medical device companies in our overall space.
"
Person2,"So I think it's giving us more relevance and better access to these customers, which will allow us to grow our business and footprint with these companies in our industry.
"
Person2,"And we will monetize it on a consumption basis.
"
Person0,"Just to add on to what <UNK> was saying about BI, just a general statement.
"
Person0,"Most of our large enterprise deals like that tend to be closer to five year duration and anywhere in the third to fifth year is where you sort of a peak revenue exit run rate, if you will.
"
Person0,"And that's really what he was referring to in terms of where we can layer on top of that additional revenues from upsells.
"
Person0,"It's been a little bit of both actually.
"
Person0,"The transformations are typically focused on either wanting to innovate faster to better science or to drive efficiencies.
"
Person0,"There are often a large number of different consultants that are involved.
"
Person0,"A partner like Accenture maybe involved in the actual transformation work and process change work that happens.
"
Person0,"But we have been the tip of the spear before and we have been asked to work with one of the other consultants early in the process.
"
Person0,"So again there is not a clear pattern there.
"
Person1,"I would say that, I think you can see in larger clients that we have, kind of a range of interest in doing things that they are doing now more efficiently.
"
Person1,"And if anything, I think that's where you probably would see numbers in front of you lean towards, okay, we need to do process reengineering, we need the technology that's going to support it.
"
Person1,"Then you also have people saying, there is things I need to do which I could never do before, and frankly, we are inventing a lot of those things.
"
Person1,"And so in that case I really think it is that kind of reputation for and continuous delivery of innovation which is driving a very specific preference for Medidata.
"
Person1,"And I think the data science component of our business is part and parcel for that.
"
Person1,"There is things that frankly I don't think you could have ever done in our industry which now, because of what we are able to both see from a breadth perspective and deliver from a scientific and product perspective, it puts us in a unique position to create things that just, like I said, didn't exist.
"
Person1,"And obviously in those cases the customer is saying I want Medidata but I do need somebody to come in and help me figure out how to get it implemented across my whole organization.
"
Person2,"Yes, of course.
"
Person2,"I think the investments that we are taking into building additional capabilities around our platform and creating new markets.
"
Person2,"I think we have been very consistent today and in previous calls that in many ways we are driving the transformation that it's reflected also in our growing pipeline.
"
Person2,"And as we have made changes and improved the organization across our company from an operations perspective, R&D as well as go-to-market, marketing, we are getting better in driving momentum in the market and converting that over time that innovation.
"
Person2,"<UNK>, what's your take.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I am not sure what the dimension of the question is trying to get you from a pipeline perspective.
"
Person1,"When we are looking at our targets for the remainder of the year, we are looking at things that we have built and delivered product around or have things that, to <UNK>'s point around confidence, we know that there are certain enhancements related to clients that we are going to pick them up.
"
Person1,"But it's not like we need to invent something new to make our 2016 real.
"
Person0,"Absolutely.
"
Person0,"I think that's the right takeaway.
"
Person0,"Each one of these incremental wins in the top 25 does a number of things.
"
Person0,"It strengthens our overall competitive position.
"
Person0,"It creates, I think, a lot of interesting dynamics in the ones who haven't moved yet.
"
Person0,"It adds significantly to the overall value of our data assets.
"
Person0,"But then when you look at the breadth of the solution that we have today, the overall platform, I think that we are in a very good position, very strong position to keep driving the upsell opportunity and drive greater adoption.
"
Person0,"And <UNK> shared some metrics with you around how Balance is doing.
"
Person0,"We mentioned Risk Based Monitoring and CSA, we are now adding Intelemage.
"
Person0,"So are feeling good about our overall solution set and how we can sustain, I think what is very healthy growth in a customer base that's more and more moving in our direction and is looking for the kind of innovation that we are bringing to market.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"We added 36 new customers in the quarter.
"
Person0,"We had some fall off.
"
Person0,"The vast majority of those were study ends.
"
Person0,"So healthy trend there.
"
Person2,"Correct.
"
Person0,"So it is a, for the most part it's competitive displacement.
"
Person0,"For us, as I said, it gives us access to 14 of the top 15 med device companies.
"
Person0,"But there is also an aspect to it that is greenfield.
"
Person0,"As you know, Intelemage sells to the commercial side as well as to the drug development side.
"
Person0,"Both of those, I think we see as opportunities for greater adoption.
"
Person0,"So there is an aspect of greenfield to it.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
