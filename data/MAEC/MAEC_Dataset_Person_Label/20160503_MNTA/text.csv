Person0,"Well, that is something that is Sandoz's decision and we are not commenting on it, but what I will comment on is this this is a very different situation than the other patents.
"
Person0,"We look at this one and think there could be some very definitive ruling in the Court, so Sandoz is an experienced generics company.
"
Person0,"They will evaluate that at the time, but we are pretty confident about this set of patents that we can get some un-ambiguous rulings here.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person0,"I will take those in order.
"
Person0,"First, our confidence on the approval -- I can not talk about specific regulatory(inaudible), but our confidence on the approval is pretty straightforward.
"
Person0,"What took the time last time was the approval of the API, all right, showing that we actually had material.
"
Person0,"There is not even a review this time.
"
Person0,"We are actually referencing our drug master file for the 20-mig product.
"
Person0,"It is exactly the same API, but this is basically a review of a reformulation so it is a much simpler review.
"
Person0,"It is a standard formulation, which is something that the FDA looks at in many, many products; so we do not anticipate anywhere near the challenges we had in the earlier program, and as the only one with an approved API we figure that give us a pretty good edge in terms of 40-mig.
"
Person0,"So we remain very confident on that approval.
"
Person0,"In terms of the draft guidance, there was really nothing unanticipated there.
"
Person0,"I think what we saw is the FDA is giving guidance in terms of the kind of things that need to be looked at.
"
Person0,"but they are continuing to respect the confidentiality (inaudible) of details of the approaches that we took to answer those questions.
"
Person0,"And that to us was our expectation, and that is we did see in the guidance.
"
Person0,"In terms of the read-through on Synthon, I think that the message that Synthon got was that if they want to use J pathway they have to show their analytic payments as well as clinical trials.
"
Person0,"So they have chosen to the J pathway I think they are still going to be held to the same analytic standard as we have as they are trying to get approval for the J so.
"
Person0,"Sure.
"
Person0,"Thank you.
"
Person0,"Thanks everybody.
"
Person0,"Thanks for accommodating our earlier time slot, and I look forward to updating you next quarter.
"
Person0,"So thanks again for joining us.
