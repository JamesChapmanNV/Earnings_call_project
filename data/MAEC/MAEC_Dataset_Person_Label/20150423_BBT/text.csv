Person1,"Typically what we do an acquisition obviously everything is mark-to-market.
"
Person1,"So you go in with a mark-to-market balance sheet.
"
Person1,"But what we always do is we basically take in all the client activity so we take in the client loans, client deposits.
"
Person1,"We were very hard to exit out any non-client borrowings except like advances and other opportunities there.
"
Person1,"And in the investment portfolio decision is really a decision on whether we need the liquidity or not.
"
Person1,"If you don't need securities or liquidity and also helps raise your margin.
"
Person1,"There are a lot of things you work with to optimize the whole overall piece so it fits into your total organization.
"
Person1,"But we will give you more color next quarter on that.
"
Person1,"It's going to be off a smaller base, because you these are smaller earning assets.
"
Person1,"There's puts and takes there.
"
Person2,"We just had really strong equity deals in the fourth-quarter that in fact strongest in our history.
"
Person2,"We had the biggest fourth quarter we could have out of that three deals, so we are just bouncing back from that.
"
Person2,"If you look at the core business it is still doing very well, good strong M&A back log.
"
Person2,"The retail broker continues -- commissions are growing about 9%, so it's really nothing more than we had a strong fourth-quarter.
"
Person1,"From a CCAR 2015, <UNK>, if you looked at the dividend request that we had and the buyback and then the four acquisitions that we had embedded in there, we had well over 100% use of our retained earnings over this five quarter period.
"
Person1,"So if you look at our common equity tier one call it 10.5 now transition basis it's probably going to end up a little better 10, call it 9.8 give or take 10 basis points, so we're going to use probably use 60 plus basis points of capital over the five quarters.
"
Person1,"I know, <UNK>, you are an old CFO finance guy, so you understand all this stuff, but if you look our match funded basis and you look at these assets, these assets have a credit spread that we are putting on the books well north of 100 basis points if you try to actually fund these assets call it 80 basis points.
"
Person1,"With the negative convexity you have and if rates eventually do go up, these assets will really start to extend out and it's just a really tough asset to really fund properly over the long term.
"
Person1,"I think selling as much as we can out and getting the revenue that we can is the right thing for our Company right now.
"
Person1,"All of our other loan businesses are growing really well.
"
Person1,"We are able to grow even with this running off, so I think that's positive.
"
Person1,"We are stabilizing core margin with basically flat interest rates which is really pretty good in this environment.
"
Person0,"<UNK>, you have to keep in mind, too, what <UNK> said is true, but our primary driver in this is diversification.
"
Person0,"We're just not going -- even if it's 5%, we're just not going to hold assets that are not consistent with our long-term diversification strategy.
"
Person0,"So we wanted to bring it down some to get it in -- it's not dramatic, but we wanted to bring it down some to get it in line with our diversification plan.
"
Person1,"It's a contributor -- I think it's one part of it, but the other piece is really the unbelievable strong growth we have gotten in core deposits.
"
Person1,"Core deposits, they are strong for the industry.
"
Person1,"Our core deposits growth in our community bank and corporate banking has been phenomenal.
"
Person1,"If you go back six or seven years ago, the percentage of DDA to our funding was in the mid-teens.
"
Person1,"We are now over 30% DDA funded.
"
Person1,"That is just a completely different BB&T.
"
Person0,"Yes, absolutely.
"
Person0,"I think that the best scenario will create the draining of the deposits in the system.
"
Person0,"I think it will create an opportunity for these asset investors to chase other assets rather than traditional banking assets.
"
Person0,"And all of that will create asset price increases for the banking segment.
"
Person1,"The deposit spreads will be challenging during that, but what I personally think is that banks will lag as rates are going up simply because we have given up a lot of deposit yield on things like NSFs and other factors over the last two or three years, we the industry.
"
Person1,"So I think all of that will be incorporated into decision-making which will cause a lag on the deposit pricing as we go up.
"
Person0,"Good morning.
"
Person1,"That's correct.
"
Person1,"We basically move a negative income item out and put it in the tax line item.
"
Person1,"We also restated 2014 financials, so if you go back and compare numbers versus last quarter you're going to see 2014 change.
"
Person1,"This is proportional accounting that we had to do for our tax credit businesses that we run.
"
Person1,"That's right, <UNK>.
