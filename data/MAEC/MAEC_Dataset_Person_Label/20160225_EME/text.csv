Person,Sentence
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person1,"We're pleased with it.
"
Person1,"The way we think of the business, T, is about 80% of that business is in the field; 20% of that business is in the shops; half of that shop business is with the new build heat exchanger capital work.
"
Person1,"Half of that shop business.
"
Person1,"So, 8% to 10%, depending on the year.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"It's -- well, it's -- I like I say, for every $1 we lose in our shops with absorption and everything else, we have to go make $2 somewhere else in EMCOR in revenue.
"
Person1,"All that being said, we had an pretty good fall turnaround season.
"
Person1,"We had an exceptional fall turnaround season in 2014.
"
Person1,"And we didn't think we were going to repeat that, and we have said that.
"
Person2,"Yes.
"
Person2,"And T, this is <UNK>.
"
Person2,"Clearly, we never recouped the lost revenues from the first quarter that didn't get executed pursuant to the refinery operator strike.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"We're building it in with a measure of confidence -- I mean, conservatism; and confidence, I guess, because it is in the conservatism, right.
"
Person1,"I look at it the other way.
"
Person1,"We never had a maintenance downturn, if you look at the last 2 years, in our refinery maintenance business in the field.
"
Person1,"We've grown -- if you take all that together -- up 40% in Q4 last year; up this year, high teens; up the year before, low 20s.
"
Person1,"I mean, we have had very strong underlying growth.
"
Person1,"But for this refinery operator strike, we would have had growing earnings in --
"
Person2,"Industrial.
"
Person1,"Industrial.
"
Person1,"Despite what happened in -- but we lost about $30 million of revenue, give or take.
"
Person1,"And that's not even taking any pull-through revenue.
"
Person1,"That's stuff we pretty much knew we were going to do.
"
Person1,"And we estimated then, I think, $0.06 or $0.08 a share.
"
Person1,"The reality was probably higher than that, because we got no pull-through work either in the shops out of those turnarounds.
"
Person1,"So, we had a pretty good 2- to 3-year run in refinery maintenance.
"
Person1,"We see no reason, with the utilization rates, that that's not going to continue on the maintenance side.
"
Person1,"The question is, how does drive -- driven miles today -- there's an article that it's up; that the refinery profitability in the Midwest is down.
"
Person1,"That'll all wash itself out.
"
Person1,"It's cyclical.
"
Person1,"I would always remind people, though, it depends on what your customers are doing during that time period.
"
Person1,"And -- less than what's actually going on in the overall market.
"
Person1,"Some people want to draw big conclusions because one company's up, one company's down.
"
Person1,"Big-picture, the market grows about 3% to 7% a year, depending on the year, on the maintenance side.
"
Person1,"That's what it's been doing.
"
Person1,"We took a lot of share here over the last couple of years.
"
Person1,"It shows the strength of the RepconStrickland acquisition and how, after the first 4 or 5 months, we were again able to hit the ground running.
"
Person1,"We feel really good about that.
"
Person1,"And quite frankly, it might be an opportunity now to be okay to look for assets in that business long-term.
"
Person1,"Because we're bullish on the petrochemical and the refinery business in the US for as far as we can see.
"
Person1,"There'll be hiccups along the way, but it's a good business.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Look, the places where we had, [quote], execution issues here in the third and fourth quarter, are the same places that have executed some of the best projects that we've ever executed.
"
Person1,"Sometimes you get in a situation on these larger projects where schedule -- we're a subcontractor.
"
Person1,"And when designs start changing and conditions start changing on the job, and schedules get elongated, what really happens on some of these jobs are, you have a set of general conditions you're operating in.
"
Person1,"You're paying for all that infrastructure in those general conditions on those jobs.
"
Person1,"You're going to be entitled to a chunk of that money after.
"
Person1,"It's going to be a fight to get it.
"
Person1,"But it's pretty clear that if the job expands 9 months, and you're spending $500,000 a month to have people at the job site doing the administration and the project management and everything else, that you're going to recoup that.
"
Person1,"We tend to be -- some people aren't -- we tend to be very conservative in our estimate of that recovery, because we like people to see where we stand today versus the execution of those jobs.
"
Person1,"So, we don't build big unbilled sections.
"
Person1,"We don't build big claim portfolios.
"
Person1,"And so, we may be a little different than other people, as you can see with the recovery in the mechanical.
"
Person1,"I'll take our execution in the transportation sector over time, against anybody's in the industry.
"
Person1,"There's a couple of things going on there.
"
Person1,"One is just flat mix of work.
"
Person1,"When we were doing the fast-turn hospitality work, where every day you can get it open is worth millions of dollars to the operator, it means a lot to get it done in prices.
"
Person1,"And when you're able to take your whole company and dedicate it to a separate large -- those large jobs, and get 100% absorption on your SG&A almost, because everybody is leaning forward and out into the field, focused on those projects, you tend to get better pricing.
"
Person1,"I think you've got a mix issue right now.
"
Person1,"And I think, also, it's just -- it's just a tougher market.
"
Person1,"This has been a very slow recovery.
"
Person1,"And in a very slow recovery, I guess we're all learning.
"
Person1,"Non-residential construction, I think, through history, tends to snap back a lot quicker.
"
Person1,"With this slow recovery, it's had a long time to absorb the work.
"
Person1,"And as a result, labor's been able to come on.
"
Person1,"Are there spot labor shortages.
"
Person1,"Sure; but nothing like you would have experienced in 2007 or 2008.
"
Person1,"So, how you get better pricing is, your resources become more valuable.
"
Person1,"Your resources, which is -- ours is labor -- becomes more valuable.
"
Person1,"You're able to get an upsell on the price.
"
Person1,"We have spots in the country where we can do that, but not -- it's not wholesale.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"I just think in general, when you look at labor, it's still very competitive in the Gulf Coast for the right kinds of labor.
"
Person1,"As one of the other analysts pointed out, we're having a 25% capacity increase in our petrochemical base.
"
Person1,"That's (inaudible) [but] upstream guys aren't downstream guys -- aren't builders; they're different kinds of people.
"
Person1,"That's not an easy migration to make for most of the skilled trades.
"
Person1,"You have very busy markets in parts of the country like Boston, and New York, and California, right now, on the trade side.
"
Person1,"But at EMCOR we don't -- we like labor tightness and shortage.
"
Person1,"We're one of the biggest in the country.
"
Person1,"And I always go back to what I think really skilled people and supervision care about.
"
Person1,"The first thing is, are you going to work for a company that's going to make sure you get paid every week.
"
Person1,"We're check, check on that.
"
Person1,"Are you going to work for a company where the supervision's competent.
"
Person1,"Forget about the five people around the table here today, or the six people around the table here today.
"
Person1,"Is the supervision in the field competent.
"
Person1,"We get triple checks on that.
"
Person1,"Maybe the most important thing, then, is, are you going to keep us safe.
"
Person1,"And we have -- every day we wake up and knock on wood, and thank -- and are very thankful that we have the focus on safety and the supervision that focuses on safety that we do.
"
Person1,"And so, we can resoundingly answer yes to that.
"
Person1,"And are you going to provide me the equipment I need to be safe.
"
Person1,"And we can resoundingly say yes to that.
"
Person1,"So, we tend to attract the best tradespeople and supervision in the industry.
"
Person1,"So, we wish labor would even get tighter.
"
Person1,"So, thanks.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"Thanks for your interest in EMCOR.
"
Person1,"We're coming off a very good 2015, and have cautious optimism as we look to 2016.
"
Person1,"Thank you.
