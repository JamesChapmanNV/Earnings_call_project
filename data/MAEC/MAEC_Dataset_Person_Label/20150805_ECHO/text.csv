Person,Sentence
Person0,"Thanks.
"
Person1,"Yes, sure, happy to do that.
"
Person1,"So I mentioned the sales headcount was 1,687 people.
"
Person1,"The agents within that headcount were 278, so that brings your sales headcount to 1,409 people.
"
Person1,"Total employees was 2,430, and that's highlighted on our earnings release as well.
"
Person1,"2,430.
"
Person1,"In total, yes.
"
Person1,"Correct, that was the end of June.
"
Person1,"That's right, yes.
"
Person1,"Well, <UNK>, yes, we've got a lot of work going on that.
"
Person1,"We've also brought in some outside help to get us through it quickly and effectively.
"
Person1,"We're targeting one year to have the technology integration completed.
"
Person0,"Yes, <UNK>, this is <UNK>.
"
Person0,"I think that is the right way to think about it.
"
Person0,"We wanted to call out the growth that we would expect to see on that base set of business and then also be able to comment on a range of synergies that we would expect to see when we bring those businesses together, but yes, you could certainly describe that as organic growth higher than that 10% to 12% once you add in those synergies.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"I mentioned that in the second half of the year, we'd expect roughly $9 million to $9.1 million of amortization in total.
"
Person0,"The Command amortization for the second half of the year, you can expect to be around $6.7 million, in that range.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"(multiple speakers).
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"It does potentially change that.
"
Person0,"I think that's one of the key issues that we'll be looking at in 2016.
"
Person0,"And we would expect that our headcount additions might be a little geared more on the client side.
"
Person0,"Over the past couple of years, they've been -- certainly with Echo as a stand-alone business, we've done a lot more investing on the sourcing side of the business to build up our truckload sourcing capability.
"
Person0,"So it's a good question and I think that we'll get more specific about that next year, but I do see the potential to do some shifting, or potentially the hiring plans might be slightly lower, given the synergies we'll get on the sourcing side.
"
Person1,"Yes, it will stay in that elevated range through the first half of next year.
"
Person1,"And then, that would come down relatively significantly.
"
Person1,"Yes, there is some portion that's a little bit longer, but as we have mentioned, it was a $10 million amount that's been amortized or expensed over a one-year period.
"
Person1,"Thanks, Matt.
"
Person1,"Yes, I think we can make that available.
"
Person1,"<UNK>, why don't you give the numbers.
"
Person0,"The reason we stopped doing that and it's okay that's it's a trigger is that with the mode mix changing, the combination of LTL and Truckload shipment volumes, it's getting more and more to maybe not be a key metric.
"
Person0,"There's no reason we can't give it, but we just kind of wanted to be cautious about triggering too much on that as the mode mix continues to shift.
"
Person1,"Yes.
"
Person1,"And it's always been a little tricky, but it's better than nothing.
"
Person1,"We do try to capture the change in revenue per load or revenue per shipment, we've [captured fairly accurately].
"
Person0,"Yes, <UNK>, the number is $645,000 on the quarter, which is up 19%.
"
Person1,"Well, I think on the enterprise client counts, we've decided that that metric as we've gotten bigger and that's a smaller part of our business, just doesn't really make sense to continue to update and disclose.
"
Person1,"We signed I think 10 new clients in the quarter.
"
Person1,"So we continue to add clients, high renewal rates, but we decided that that was just kind of getting to the extra information that was necessary to really driving the financial results.
"
Person1,"So we have kind of backed off on disclosing that.
"
Person1,"I think transactional client were -- there's no reason we can't disclose that and --
"
Person0,"Yes, total clients we've worked with during the quarter and now, this includes Command as well, is 24,200.
"
Person0,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person0,"The cash interest expense, yes, I'd expect somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.3 million to $3.4 million for the second half of the year.
"
Person0,"So $200 million to $300 million of expected revenue from acquisitions by 2018 and also $200 million to $300 million of expected additional revenue from synergies through the Command integration in addition to the organic revenue of 10% to 12%.
"
Person0,"Yes.
"
Person0,"So we haven't really given a percentage there.
"
Person0,"As you know, we don't guide to a margin percentage and that operating leverage is really a factor of the leverage we get over those net revenue dollars, so it's little harder for me to pinpoint something there without giving a margin percentage, but we do expect that to continue to accelerate.
"
Person0,"Obviously, that synergistic revenue is very accretive revenue for us and we'd expect that to have a nice incremental margin impact.
"
Person0,"So we're excited about that.
"
Person0,"So hopefully, that's helpful.
"
Person1,"It's going to ebb and flow depending on the quarters in the seasons and the timing of when the integration happens and when those revenue synergies come in.
"
Person1,"I think a good number to use is kind of high 30s, low 40s as an incremental margin percentage.
"
Person1,"Correct.
"
Person1,"Thanks, <UNK>.
"
Person1,"Well, I will appreciate everybody joining us today.
"
Person1,"We feel real good about the business.
"
Person1,"We're proud of the execution.
"
Person1,"We're excited about the Command deal and we look forward to talking to you all in the coming quarter and on the next call.
"
Person1,"So, thanks for joining us.
"
